### <a href="README.md#bookmark-ov"><img src="content/assets/svg/caret-up.svg"  width="20" alt="caret up" id="bookmark-ov" /></a> Introduction <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="intro-ov" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>


Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Under the hood, Nest makes use of robust HTTP Server frameworks like [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (the default) and optionally can be configured to use [Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify) as well!

Nest provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Fastify), but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This gives developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules which are available for the underlying platform.

#### Philosophy

In recent years, thanks to Node.js, JavaScript has become the ‚Äúlingua franca‚Äù of the web for both front and backend applications. This has given rise to awesome projects like [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), which improve developer productivity and enable the creation of fast, testable, and extensible frontend applications. However, while plenty of superb libraries, helpers, and tools exist for Node (and server-side JavaScript), none of them effectively solve the main problem of - **Architecture**.

Nest provides an out-of-the-box application architecture which allows developers and teams to create highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled, and easily maintainable applications. The architecture is heavily inspired by Angular.

#### Installation

To get started, you can either scaffold the project with the [Nest CLI](/cli/overview), or clone a starter project (both will produce the same outcome).

To scaffold the project with the Nest CLI, run the following commands. This will create a new project directory, and populate the directory with the initial core Nest files and supporting modules, creating a conventional base structure for your project. Creating a new project with the **Nest CLI** is recommended for first-time users. We'll continue with this approach in [First Steps](first-steps).

```bash
$ npm i -g @nestjs/cli
$ nest new project-name
```

Alternatively, to install the TypeScript starter project with **Git**:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nestjs/typescript-starter.git project
$ cd project
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

Open your browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/).

To install the JavaScript flavor of the starter project, use `javascript-starter.git` in the command sequence above.

You can also manually create a new project from scratch by installing the core and supporting files with **npm** (or **yarn**). In this case, of course, you'll be responsible for creating the project boilerplate files yourself.

```bash
$ npm i --save @nestjs/core @nestjs/common rxjs reflect-metadata
```
### First steps <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="first-steps" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

In this set of articles, you'll learn the **core fundamentals** of Nest. To get familiar with the essential building blocks of Nest applications, we'll build a basic CRUD application with features that cover a lot of ground at an introductory level.

#### Language

We're in love with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), but above all - we love [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). That's why Nest is compatible with both TypeScript and **pure JavaScript**. Nest takes advantage of the latest language features, so to use it with vanilla JavaScript we need a [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) compiler.

We'll mostly use TypeScript in the examples we provide, but you can always **switch the code snippets** to vanilla JavaScript syntax (simply click to toggle the language button in the upper right hand corner of each snippet).

#### Prerequisites

Please make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 10.13.0) is installed on your operating system.

#### Setup

Setting up a new project is quite simple with the [Nest CLI](/cli/overview). With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, you can create a new Nest project with the following commands in your OS terminal:

```bash
$ npm i -g @nestjs/cli
$ nest new project-name
```

The `project` directory will be created, node modules and a few other boilerplate files will be installed, and a `src/` directory will be created and populated with several core files.

<div class="file-tree">
  <div class="item">src</div>
  <div class="children">
    <div class="item">app.controller.ts</div>
    <div class="item">app.module.ts</div>
    <div class="item">main.ts</div>
  </div>
</div>

Here's a brief overview of those core files:

|                     |                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.controller.ts` | Basic controller sample with a single route.                                                                        |
| `app.module.ts`     | The root module of the application.                                                                                 |
| `main.ts`           | The entry file of the application which uses the core function `NestFactory` to create a Nest application instance. |

The `main.ts` includes an async function, which will **bootstrap** our application:

```typescript
@@filename(main)

import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
@@switch
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

To create a Nest application instance, we use the core `NestFactory` class. `NestFactory` exposes a few static methods that allow creating an application instance. The `create()` method returns an application object, which fulfills the `INestApplication` interface. This object provides a set of methods which are described in the coming chapters. In the `main.ts` example above, we simply start up our HTTP listener, which lets the application await inbound HTTP requests.

Note that a project scaffolded with the Nest CLI creates an initial project structure that encourages developers to follow the convention of keeping each module in its own dedicated directory.

#### Platform

Nest aims to be a platform-agnostic framework. Platform independence makes it possible to create reusable logical parts that developers can take advantage of across several different types of applications. Technically, Nest is able to work with any Node HTTP framework once an adapter is created. There are two HTTP platforms supported out-of-the-box: [express](https://expressjs.com/) and [fastify](https://www.fastify.io). You can choose the one that best suits your needs.

|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `platform-express` | [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a well-known minimalist web framework for node. It's a battle tested, production-ready library with lots of resources implemented by the community. The `@nestjs/platform-express` package is used by default. Many users are well served with Express, and need take no action to enable it. |
| `platform-fastify` | [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) is a high performance and low overhead framework highly focused on providing maximum efficiency and speed. Read how to use it [here](/techniques/performance).                                                                                                                                  |

Whichever platform is used, it exposes its own application interface. These are seen respectively as `NestExpressApplication` and `NestFastifyApplication`.

When you pass a type to the `NestFactory.create()` method, as in the example below, the `app` object will have methods available exclusively for that specific platform. Note, however, you don't **need** to specify a type **unless** you actually want to access the underlying platform API.

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create<NestExpressApplication>(AppModule);
```

#### Running the application

Once the installation process is complete, you can run the following command at your OS command prompt to start the application listening for inbound HTTP requests:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

This command starts the app with the HTTP server listening on the port defined in the `src/main.ts` file. Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. You should see the `Hello World!` message.

### Controllers <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/controllers"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="controllers" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Controllers are responsible for handling incoming **requests** and returning **responses** to the client.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/Controllers_1.png" /></figure>

A controller's purpose is to receive specific requests for the application. The **routing** mechanism controls which controller receives which requests. Frequently, each controller has more than one route, and different routes can perform different actions.

In order to create a basic controller, we use classes and **decorators**. Decorators associate classes with required metadata and enable Nest to create a routing map (tie requests to the corresponding controllers).

#### Routing

In the following example we'll use the `@Controller()` decorator, which is **required** to define a basic controller. We'll specify an optional route path prefix of `cats`. Using a path prefix in a `@Controller()` decorator allows us to easily group a set of related routes, and minimize repetitive code. For example, we may choose to group a set of routes that manage interactions with a customer entity under the route `/customers`. In that case, we could specify the path prefix `customers` in the `@Controller()` decorator so that we don't have to repeat that portion of the path for each route in the file.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  @Get()
  findAll(): string {
    return 'This action returns all cats';
  }
}
@@switch
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  @Get()
  findAll() {
    return 'This action returns all cats';
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** To create a controller using the CLI, simply execute the `$ nest g controller cats` command.

The `@Get()` HTTP request method decorator before the `findAll()` method tells Nest to create a handler for a specific endpoint for HTTP requests. The endpoint corresponds to the HTTP request method (GET in this case) and the route path. What is the route path? The route path for a handler is determined by concatenating the (optional) prefix declared for the controller, and any path specified in the request decorator. Since we've declared a prefix for every route ( `cats`), and haven't added any path information in the decorator, Nest will map `GET /cats` requests to this handler. As mentioned, the path includes both the optional controller path prefix **and** any path string declared in the request method decorator. For example, a path prefix of `customers` combined with the decorator `@Get('profile')` would produce a route mapping for requests like `GET /customers/profile`.

In our example above, when a GET request is made to this endpoint, Nest routes the request to our user-defined `findAll()` method. Note that the method name we choose here is completely arbitrary. We obviously must declare a method to bind the route to, but Nest doesn't attach any significance to the method name chosen.

This method will return a 200 status code and the associated response, which in this case is just a string. Why does that happen? To explain, we'll first introduce the concept that Nest employs two **different** options for manipulating responses:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Standard (recommended)</td>
    <td>
      Using this built-in method, when a request handler returns a JavaScript object or array, it will <strong>automatically</strong>
      be serialized to JSON. When it returns a JavaScript primitive type (e.g., <code>string</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>boolean</code>), however, Nest will send just the value without attempting to serialize it. This makes response handling simple: just return the value, and Nest takes care of the rest.
      <br />
      <br /> Furthermore, the response's <strong>status code</strong> is always 200 by default, except for POST
      requests which use 201. We can easily change this behavior by adding the <code>@HttpCode(...)</code>
      decorator at a handler-level (see <a href='controllers#status-code'>Status codes</a>).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Library-specific</td>
    <td>
      We can use the library-specific (e.g., Express) <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">response object</a>, which can be injected using the <code>@Res()</code> decorator in the method handler signature (e.g., <code>findAll(@Res() response)</code>).  With this approach, you have the ability (and the responsibility), to use the native response handling methods exposed by that object.  For example, with Express, you can construct responses using code like <code>response.status(200).send()</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

> warning **Warning** You cannot use both approaches at the same time. Nest detects when the handler is using either `@Res()` or `@Next()`, indicating you have chosen the library-specific option. If both approaches are used at the same time, the Standard approach is **automatically disabled** for this single route and will no longer work as expected.

<app-banner-enterprise></app-banner-enterprise>

#### Request object

Handlers often need access to the client **request** details. Nest provides access to the [request object](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req) of the underlying platform (Express by default). We can access the request object by instructing Nest to inject it by adding the `@Req()` decorator to the handler's signature.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
import { Controller, Get, Req } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Request } from 'express';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  @Get()
  findAll(@Req() request: Request): string {
    return 'This action returns all cats';
  }
}
@@switch
import { Controller, Bind, Get, Req } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  @Get()
  @Bind(Req())
  findAll(request) {
    return 'This action returns all cats';
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** In order to take advantage of `express` typings (as in the `request: Request` parameter example above), install `@types/express` package.

The request object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, HTTP headers, and body (read more [here](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req)). In most cases, it's not necessary to grab these properties manually. We can use dedicated decorators instead, such as `@Body()` or `@Query()`, which are available out of the box. Below is a list of the provided decorators and the plain platform-specific objects they represent.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Request(), @Req()</code></td>
      <td><code>req</code></td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Response(), @Res()</code><span class="table-code-asterisk">*</span></td>
      <td><code>res</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Next()</code></td>
      <td><code>next</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Session()</code></td>
      <td><code>req.session</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Param(key?: string)</code></td>
      <td><code>req.params</code> / <code>req.params[key]</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Body(key?: string)</code></td>
      <td><code>req.body</code> / <code>req.body[key]</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Query(key?: string)</code></td>
      <td><code>req.query</code> / <code>req.query[key]</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Headers(name?: string)</code></td>
      <td><code>req.headers</code> / <code>req.headers[name]</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Ip()</code></td>
      <td><code>req.ip</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@HostParam()</code></td>
      <td><code>req.hosts</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<sup>\* </sup>For compatibility with typings across underlying HTTP platforms (e.g., Express and Fastify), Nest provides `@Res()` and `@Response()` decorators. `@Res()` is simply an alias for `@Response()`. Both directly expose the underlying native platform `response` object interface. When using them, you should also import the typings for the underlying library (e.g., `@types/express`) to take full advantage. Note that when you inject either `@Res()` or `@Response()` in a method handler, you put Nest into **Library-specific mode** for that handler, and you become responsible for managing the response. When doing so, you must issue some kind of response by making a call on the `response` object (e.g., `res.json(...)` or `res.send(...)`), or the HTTP server will hang.

> info **Hint** To learn how to create your own custom decorators, visit [this](/custom-decorators) chapter.

#### Resources

Earlier, we defined an endpoint to fetch the cats resource (**GET** route). We'll typically also want to provide an endpoint that creates new records. For this, let's create the **POST** handler:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
import { Controller, Get, Post } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  @Post()
  create(): string {
    return 'This action adds a new cat';
  }

  @Get()
  findAll(): string {
    return 'This action returns all cats';
  }
}
@@switch
import { Controller, Get, Post } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  @Post()
  create() {
    return 'This action adds a new cat';
  }

  @Get()
  findAll() {
    return 'This action returns all cats';
  }
}
```

It's that simple. Nest provides decorators for all of the standard HTTP methods: `@Get`, `@Post`, `@Put()`, `@Delete()`, `@Patch()`, `@Options()`, and `@Head()`. In addition, `@All()` defines an endpoint that handles all of them.

#### Route wildcards

Pattern based routes are supported as well. For instance, the asterisk is used as a wildcard, and will match any combination of characters.

```typescript
@Get('ab*cd')
findAll() {
  return 'This route uses a wildcard';
}
```

The `'ab*cd'` route path will match `abcd`, `ab_cd`, `abecd`, and so on. The characters `?`, `+`, `*`, and `()` may be used in a route path, and are subsets of their regular expression counterparts. The hyphen ( `-`) and the dot (`.`) are interpreted literally by string-based paths.

#### Status code

As mentioned, the response **status code** is always **200** by default, except for POST requests which are **201**. We can easily change this behavior by adding the `@HttpCode(...)` decorator at a handler level.

```typescript
@Post()
@HttpCode(204)
create() {
  return 'This action adds a new cat';
}
```

> info **Hint** Import `HttpCode` from the `@nestjs/common` package.

Often, your status code isn't static but depends on various factors. In that case, you can use a library-specific **response** (inject using `@Res()`) object (or, in case of an error, throw an exception).

#### Headers

To specify a custom response header, you can either use a `@Header()` decorator or a library-specific response object (and call `res.header()` directly).

```typescript
@Post()
@Header('Cache-Control', 'none')
create() {
  return 'This action adds a new cat';
}
```

> info **Hint** Import `Header` from the `@nestjs/common` package.

#### Redirection

To redirect a response to a specific URL, you can either use a `@Redirect()` decorator or a library-specific response object (and call `res.redirect()` directly).

`@Redirect()` takes a required `url` argument, and an optional `statusCode` argument. The `statusCode` defaults to `302` (`Found`) if omitted.

```typescript
@Get()
@Redirect('https://nestjs.com', 301)
```

Sometimes you may want to determine the HTTP status code or the redirect URL dynamically. Do this by returning an object from the route handler method with the shape:

```json
{
  "url": string,
  "statusCode": number
}
```

Returned values will override any arguments passed to the `@Redirect()` decorator. For example:

```typescript
@Get('docs')
@Redirect('https://docs.nestjs.com', 302)
getDocs(@Query('version') version) {
  if (version && version === '5') {
    return { url: 'https://docs.nestjs.com/v5/' };
  }
}
```

#### Route parameters

Routes with static paths won't work when you need to accept **dynamic data** as part of the request (e.g., `GET /cats/1` to get cat with id `1`). In order to define routes with parameters, we can add route parameter **tokens** in the path of the route to capture the dynamic value at that position in the request URL. The route parameter token in the `@Get()` decorator example below demonstrates this usage. Route parameters declared in this way can be accessed using the `@Param()` decorator, which should be added to the method signature.

```typescript
@@filename()
@Get(':id')
findOne(@Param() params): string {
  console.log(params.id);
  return `This action returns a #${params.id} cat`;
}
@@switch
@Get(':id')
@Bind(Param())
findOne(params) {
  console.log(params.id);
  return `This action returns a #${params.id} cat`;
}
```

`@Param()` is used to decorate a method parameter (`params` in the example above), and makes the **route** parameters available as properties of that decorated method parameter inside the body of the method. As seen in the code above, we can access the `id` parameter by referencing `params.id`. You can also pass in a particular parameter token to the decorator, and then reference the route parameter directly by name in the method body.

> info **Hint** Import `Param` from the `@nestjs/common` package.

```typescript
@@filename()
@Get(':id')
findOne(@Param('id') id): string {
  return `This action returns a #${id} cat`;
}
@@switch
@Get(':id')
@Bind(Param('id'))
findOne(id) {
  return `This action returns a #${id} cat`;
}
```

#### Sub-Domain Routing

The `@Controller` decorator can take a `host` option to require that the HTTP host of the incoming requests matches some specific value.

```typescript
@Controller({ host: 'admin.example.com' })
export class AdminController {
  @Get()
  index(): string {
    return 'Admin page';
  }
}
```

> **Warning** Since **Fastify** lacks support for nested routers, when using sub-domain routing, the (default) Express adapter should be used instead.

Similar to a route `path`, the `hosts` option can use tokens to capture the dynamic value at that position in the host name. The host parameter token in the `@Controller()` decorator example below demonstrates this usage. Host parameters declared in this way can be accessed using the `@HostParam()` decorator, which should be added to the method signature.

```typescript
@Controller({ host: ':account.example.com' })
export class AccountController {
  @Get()
  getInfo(@HostParam('account') account: string) {
    return account;
  }
}
```

#### Scopes

For people coming from different programming language backgrounds, it might be unexpected to learn that in Nest, almost everything is shared across incoming requests. We have a connection pool to the database, singleton services with global state, etc. Remember that Node.js doesn't follow the request/response Multi-Threaded Stateless Model in which every request is processed by a separate thread. Hence, using singleton instances is fully **safe** for our applications.

However, there are edge-cases when request-based lifetime of the controller may be the desired behavior, for instance per-request caching in GraphQL applications, request tracking or multi-tenancy. Learn how to control scopes [here](/fundamentals/injection-scopes).

#### Asynchronicity

We love modern JavaScript and we know that data extraction is mostly **asynchronous**. That's why Nest supports and works well with `async` functions.

> info **Hint** Learn more about `async / await` feature¬†[here](https://kamilmysliwiec.com/typescript-2-1-introduction-async-await)

Every async function has to return a `Promise`. This means that you can return a deferred value that Nest will be able to resolve by itself. Let's see an example of this:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Get()
async findAll(): Promise<any[]> {
  return [];
}
@@switch
@Get()
async findAll() {
  return [];
}
```

The above code is fully valid. Furthermore, Nest route handlers are even more powerful by being able to return RxJS [observable streams](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/class/es6/Observable.js~Observable.html). Nest will automatically subscribe to the source underneath and take the last emitted value (once the stream is completed).

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Get()
findAll(): Observable<any[]> {
  return of([]);
}
@@switch
@Get()
findAll() {
  return of([]);
}
```

Both of the above approaches work and you can use whatever fits your requirements.

#### Request payloads

Our previous example of the POST route handler didn't accept any client params. Let's fix this by adding the `@Body()` decorator here.

But first (if you use TypeScript), we need to determine the **DTO** (Data Transfer Object) schema. A DTO is an object that defines how the data will be sent over the network. We could determine the DTO schema by using **TypeScript** interfaces, or by simple classes. Interestingly, we recommend using **classes** here. Why? Classes are part of the JavaScript ES6 standard, and therefore they are preserved as real entities in the compiled JavaScript. On the other hand, since TypeScript interfaces are removed during the transpilation, Nest can't refer to them at runtime. This is important because features such as **Pipes** enable additional possibilities when they have access to the metatype of the variable at runtime.

Let's create the `CreateCatDto` class:

```typescript
@@filename(create-cat.dto)
export class CreateCatDto {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  breed: string;
}
```

It has only three basic properties. Thereafter we can use the newly created DTO inside the `CatsController`:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Post()
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  return 'This action adds a new cat';
}
@@switch
@Post()
@Bind(Body())
async create(createCatDto) {
  return 'This action adds a new cat';
}
```

#### Handling errors

There's a separate chapter about handling errors (i.e., working with exceptions) [here](/exception-filters).

#### Full resource sample

Below is an example that makes use of several of the available decorators to create a basic controller. This controller exposes a couple of methods to access and manipulate internal data.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
import { Controller, Get, Query, Post, Body, Put, Param, Delete } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CreateCatDto, UpdateCatDto, ListAllEntities } from './dto';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  @Post()
  create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
    return 'This action adds a new cat';
  }

  @Get()
  findAll(@Query() query: ListAllEntities) {
    return `This action returns all cats (limit: ${query.limit} items)`;
  }

  @Get(':id')
  findOne(@Param('id') id: string) {
    return `This action returns a #${id} cat`;
  }

  @Put(':id')
  update(@Param('id') id: string, @Body() updateCatDto: UpdateCatDto) {
    return `This action updates a #${id} cat`;
  }

  @Delete(':id')
  remove(@Param('id') id: string) {
    return `This action removes a #${id} cat`;
  }
}
@@switch
import { Controller, Get, Query, Post, Body, Put, Param, Delete, Bind } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  @Post()
  @Bind(Body())
  create(createCatDto) {
    return 'This action adds a new cat';
  }

  @Get()
  @Bind(Query())
  findAll(query) {
    console.log(query);
    return `This action returns all cats (limit: ${query.limit} items)`;
  }

  @Get(':id')
  @Bind(Param('id'))
  findOne(id) {
    return `This action returns a #${id} cat`;
  }

  @Put(':id')
  @Bind(Param('id'), Body())
  update(id, updateCatDto) {
    return `This action updates a #${id} cat`;
  }

  @Delete(':id')
  @Bind(Param('id'))
  remove(id) {
    return `This action removes a #${id} cat`;
  }
}
```

#### Getting up and running

With the above controller fully defined, Nest still doesn't know that `CatsController` exists and as a result won't create an instance of this class.

Controllers always belong to a module, which is why we include the `controllers` array within the `@Module()` decorator. Since we haven't yet defined any other modules except the root `AppModule`, we'll use that to introduce the `CatsController`:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsController } from './cats/cats.controller';

@Module({
  controllers: [CatsController],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

We attached the metadata to the module class using the `@Module()` decorator, and Nest can now easily reflect which controllers have to be mounted.

<app-banner-shop></app-banner-shop>

#### Appendix: Library-specific approach

So far we've discussed the Nest standard way of manipulating responses. The second way of manipulating the response is to use a library-specific [response object](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res). In order to inject a particular response object, we need to use the `@Res()` decorator. To show the differences, let's rewrite the `CatsController` to the following:

```typescript
@@filename()
import { Controller, Get, Post, Res, HttpStatus } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Response } from 'express';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  @Post()
  create(@Res() res: Response) {
    res.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).send();
  }

  @Get()
  findAll(@Res() res: Response) {
     res.status(HttpStatus.OK).json([]);
  }
}
@@switch
import { Controller, Get, Post, Bind, Res, Body, HttpStatus } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  @Post()
  @Bind(Res(), Body())
  create(res, createCatDto) {
    res.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).send();
  }

  @Get()
  @Bind(Res())
  findAll(res) {
     res.status(HttpStatus.OK).json([]);
  }
}
```

Though this approach works, and does in fact allow for more flexibility in some ways by providing full control of the response object (headers manipulation, library-specific features, and so on), it should be used with care. In general, the approach is much less clear and does have some disadvantages. The main disadvantages are that you lose compatibility with Nest features that depend on Nest standard response handling, such as Interceptors and the `@HttpCode()` decorator. Also, your code can become platform-dependent (as underlying libraries may have different APIs on the response object), and harder to test (you'll have to mock the response object, etc.).

As a result, the Nest standard approach should always be preferred when possible.
### Providers <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/providers"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="providers" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Providers are a fundamental concept in Nest. Many of the basic Nest classes may be treated as a provider ‚Äì services, repositories, factories, helpers, and so on. The main idea of a provider is that it can **inject** dependencies; this means objects can create various relationships with each other, and the function of "wiring up" instances of objects can largely be delegated to the Nest runtime system. A provider is simply a class annotated with an `@Injectable()` decorator.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/Components_1.png" /></figure>

In the previous chapter, we built a simple `CatsController`. Controllers should handle HTTP requests and delegate more complex tasks to **providers**. Providers are plain JavaScript classes with an `@Injectable()` decorator preceding their class declaration.

> info **Hint** Since Nest enables the possibility to design and organize dependencies in a more OO-way, we strongly recommend following the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles.

#### Services

Let's start by creating a simple `CatsService`. This service will be responsible for data storage and retrieval, and is designed to be used by the `CatsController`, so it's a good candidate to be defined as a provider. Thus, we decorate the class with `@Injectable()`.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.service)
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Cat } from './interfaces/cat.interface';

@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  private readonly cats: Cat[] = [];

  create(cat: Cat) {
    this.cats.push(cat);
  }

  findAll(): Cat[] {
    return this.cats;
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  constructor() {
    this.cats = [];
  }

  create(cat) {
    this.cats.push(cat);
  }

  findAll() {
    return this.cats;
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** To create a service using the CLI, simply execute the `$ nest g service cats` command.

Our `CatsService` is a basic class with one property and two methods. The only new feature is that it uses the `@Injectable()` decorator. The `@Injectable()` decorator attaches metadata, which tells Nest that this class is a Nest provider. By the way, this example also uses a `Cat` interface, which probably looks something like this:

```typescript
@@filename(interfaces/cat.interface)
export interface Cat {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  breed: string;
}
```

Now that we have a service class to retrieve cats, let's use it inside the `CatsController`:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
import { Controller, Get, Post, Body } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CreateCatDto } from './dto/create-cat.dto';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';
import { Cat } from './interfaces/cat.interface';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  constructor(private catsService: CatsService) {}

  @Post()
  async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
    this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
  }

  @Get()
  async findAll(): Promise<Cat[]> {
    return this.catsService.findAll();
  }
}
@@switch
import { Controller, Get, Post, Body, Bind, Dependencies } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';

@Controller('cats')
@Dependencies(CatsService)
export class CatsController {
  constructor(catsService) {
    this.catsService = catsService;
  }

  @Post()
  @Bind(Body())
  async create(createCatDto) {
    this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
  }

  @Get()
  async findAll() {
    return this.catsService.findAll();
  }
}
```

The `CatsService` is **injected** through the class constructor. Notice the use of the `private` syntax. This shorthand allows us to both declare and initialize the `catsService` member immediately in the same location.

#### Dependency injection

Nest is built around the strong design pattern commonly known as **Dependency injection**. We recommend reading a great article about this concept in the official [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection) documentation.

In Nest, thanks to TypeScript capabilities, it's extremely easy to manage dependencies because they are resolved just by type. In the example below, Nest will resolve the `catsService` by creating and returning an instance of `CatsService` (or, in the normal case of a singleton, returning the existing instance if it has already been requested elsewhere). This dependency is resolved and passed to your controller's constructor (or assigned to the indicated property):

```typescript
constructor(private catsService: CatsService) {}
```

#### Scopes

Providers normally have a lifetime ("scope") synchronized with the application lifecycle. When the application is bootstrapped, every dependency must be resolved, and therefore every provider has to be instantiated. Similarly, when the application shuts down, each provider will be destroyed. However, there are ways to make your provider lifetime **request-scoped** as well. You can read more about these techniques [here](/fundamentals/injection-scopes).

<app-banner-courses></app-banner-courses>

#### Custom providers

Nest has a built-in inversion of control ("IoC") container that resolves relationships between providers. This feature underlies the dependency injection feature described above, but is in fact far more powerful than what we've described so far. The `@Injectable()` decorator is only the tip of the iceberg, and is not the only way to define providers. In fact, you can use plain values, classes, and either asynchronous or synchronous factories. More examples are provided [here](/fundamentals/dependency-injection).

#### Optional providers

Occasionally, you might have dependencies which do not necessarily have to be resolved. For instance, your class may depend on a **configuration object**, but if none is passed, the default values should be used. In such a case, the dependency becomes optional, because lack of the configuration provider wouldn't lead to errors.

To indicate a provider is optional, use the `@Optional()` decorator in the constructor's signature.

```typescript
import { Injectable, Optional, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class HttpService<T> {
  constructor(@Optional() @Inject('HTTP_OPTIONS') private httpClient: T) {}
}
```

Note that in the example above we are using a custom provider, which is the reason we include the `HTTP_OPTIONS` custom **token**. Previous examples showed constructor-based injection indicating a dependency through a class in the constructor. Read more about custom providers and their associated tokens [here](/fundamentals/custom-providers).

#### Property-based injection

The technique we've used so far is called constructor-based injection, as providers are injected via the constructor method. In some very specific cases, **property-based injection** might be useful. For instance, if your top-level class depends on either one or multiple providers, passing them all the way up by calling `super()` in sub-classes from the constructor can be very tedious. In order to avoid this, you can use the `@Inject()` decorator at the property level.

```typescript
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class HttpService<T> {
  @Inject('HTTP_OPTIONS')
  private readonly httpClient: T;
}
```

> warning **Warning** If your class doesn't extend another provider, you should always prefer using **constructor-based** injection.

#### Provider registration

Now that we have defined a provider (`CatsService`), and we have a consumer of that service (`CatsController`), we need to register the service with Nest so that it can perform the injection. We do this by editing our module file (`app.module.ts`) and adding the service to the `providers` array of the `@Module()` decorator.

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsController } from './cats/cats.controller';
import { CatsService } from './cats/cats.service';

@Module({
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [CatsService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Nest will now be able to resolve the dependencies of the `CatsController` class.

This is how our directory structure should look now:

<div class="file-tree">
<div class="item">src</div>
<div class="children">
<div class="item">cats</div>
<div class="children">
<div class="item">dto</div>
<div class="children">
<div class="item">create-cat.dto.ts</div>
</div>
<div class="item">interfaces</div>
<div class="children">
<div class="item">cat.interface.ts</div>
</div>
<div class="item">cats.service.ts</div>
<div class="item">cats.controller.ts</div>
</div>
<div class="item">app.module.ts</div>
<div class="item">main.ts</div>
</div>
</div>

#### Manual instantiation

Thus far, we've discussed how Nest automatically handles most of the details of resolving dependencies.  In certain circumstances, you may need to step outside of the built-in Dependency Injection system and manually retrieve or instantiate providers. We briefly discuss two such topics below.

 To get existing instances, or instantiate providers dynamically, you can use [Module reference](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/module-ref).

 To get providers within the `bootstrap()` function (for example for standalone applications without controllers, or to utilize a configuration service during bootstrapping) see [Standalone applications](https://docs.nestjs.com/standalone-applications).
### Modules <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/modules"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="modules" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

A module is a class annotated with a `@Module()` decorator. The `@Module()` decorator provides metadata that **Nest** makes use of to organize the application structure.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/Modules_1.png" /></figure>

Each application has at least one module, a **root module**. The root module is the starting point Nest uses to build the **application graph** - the internal data structure Nest uses to resolve module and provider relationships and dependencies. While very small applications may theoretically have just the root module, this is not the typical case. We want to emphasize that modules are **strongly** recommended as an effective way to organize your components. Thus, for most applications, the resulting architecture will employ multiple modules, each encapsulating a closely related set of **capabilities**.

The `@Module()` decorator takes a single object whose properties describe the module:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>providers</code></td>
    <td>the providers that will be instantiated by the Nest injector and that may be shared at least across this module</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>controllers</code></td>
    <td>the set of controllers defined in this module which have to be instantiated</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>imports</code></td>
    <td>the list of imported modules that export the providers which are required in this module</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>exports</code></td>
    <td>the subset of <code>providers</code> that are provided by this module and should be available in other modules which import this module</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The module **encapsulates** providers by default. This means that it's impossible to inject providers that are neither directly part of the current module nor exported from the imported modules. Thus, you may consider the exported providers from a module as the module's public interface, or API.

#### Feature modules

The `CatsController` and `CatsService` belong to the same application domain. As they are closely related, it makes sense to move them into a feature module. A feature module simply organizes code relevant for a specific feature, keeping code organized and establishing clear boundaries. This helps us manage complexity and develop with [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles, especially as the size of the application and/or team grow.

To demonstrate this, we'll create the `CatsModule`.

```typescript
@@filename(cats/cats.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsController } from './cats.controller';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';

@Module({
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [CatsService],
})
export class CatsModule {}
```

> info **Hint** To create a module using the CLI, simply execute the `$ nest g module cats` command.

Above, we defined the `CatsModule` in the `cats.module.ts` file, and moved everything related to this module into the `cats` directory. The last thing we need to do is import this module into the root module (the `AppModule`, defined in the `app.module.ts` file).

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsModule } from './cats/cats.module';

@Module({
  imports: [CatsModule],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Here is how our directory structure looks now:

<div class="file-tree">
  <div class="item">src</div>
  <div class="children">
    <div class="item">cats</div>
    <div class="children">
      <div class="item">dto</div>
      <div class="children">
        <div class="item">create-cat.dto.ts</div>
      </div>
      <div class="item">interfaces</div>
      <div class="children">
        <div class="item">cat.interface.ts</div>
      </div>
      <div class="item">cats.service.ts</div>
      <div class="item">cats.controller.ts</div>
      <div class="item">cats.module.ts</div>
    </div>
    <div class="item">app.module.ts</div>
    <div class="item">main.ts</div>
  </div>
</div>

#### Shared modules

In Nest, modules are **singletons** by default, and thus you can share the same instance of any provider between multiple modules effortlessly.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/Shared_Module_1.png" /></figure>

Every module is automatically a **shared module**. Once created it can be reused by any module. Let's imagine that we want to share an instance of the `CatsService` between several other modules. In order to do that, we first need to **export** the `CatsService` provider by adding it to the module's `exports` array, as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsController } from './cats.controller';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';

@Module({
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [CatsService],
  exports: [CatsService]
})
export class CatsModule {}
```

Now any module that imports the `CatsModule` has access to the `CatsService` and will share the same instance with all other modules that import it as well.

<app-banner-enterprise></app-banner-enterprise>

#### Module re-exporting

As seen above, Modules can export their internal providers. In addition, they can re-export modules that they import. In the example below, the `CommonModule` is both imported into **and** exported from the `CoreModule`, making it available for other modules which import this one.

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [CommonModule],
  exports: [CommonModule],
})
export class CoreModule {}
```

#### Dependency injection

A module class can **inject** providers as well (e.g., for configuration purposes):

```typescript
@@filename(cats.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsController } from './cats.controller';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';

@Module({
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [CatsService],
})
export class CatsModule {
  constructor(private catsService: CatsService) {}
}
@@switch
import { Module, Dependencies } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsController } from './cats.controller';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';

@Module({
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [CatsService],
})
@Dependencies(CatsService)
export class CatsModule {
  constructor(catsService) {
    this.catsService = catsService;
  }
}
```

However, module classes themselves cannot be injected as providers due to [circular dependency](/fundamentals/circular-dependency) .

#### Global modules

If you have to import the same set of modules everywhere, it can get tedious. Unlike in Nest, [Angular](https://angular.io) `providers` are registered in the global scope. Once defined, they're available everywhere. Nest, however, encapsulates providers inside the module scope. You aren't able to use a module's providers elsewhere without first importing the encapsulating module.

When you want to provide a set of providers which should be available everywhere out-of-the-box (e.g., helpers, database connections, etc.), make the module **global** with the `@Global()` decorator.

```typescript
import { Module, Global } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsController } from './cats.controller';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';

@Global()
@Module({
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [CatsService],
  exports: [CatsService],
})
export class CatsModule {}
```

The `@Global()` decorator makes the module global-scoped. Global modules should be registered **only once**, generally by the root or core module. In the above example, the `CatsService` provider will be ubiquitous, and modules that wish to inject the service will not need to import the `CatsModule` in their imports array.

> info **Hint** Making everything global is not a good design decision. Global modules are available to reduce the amount of necessary boilerplate. The `imports` array is generally the preferred way to make the module's API available to consumers.

#### Dynamic modules

The Nest module system includes a powerful feature called **dynamic modules**. This feature enables you to easily create customizable modules that can register and configure providers dynamically. Dynamic modules are covered extensively [here](/fundamentals/dynamic-modules). In this chapter, we'll give a brief overview to complete the introduction to modules.

Following is an example of a dynamic module definition for a `DatabaseModule`:

```typescript
@@filename()
import { Module, DynamicModule } from '@nestjs/common';
import { createDatabaseProviders } from './database.providers';
import { Connection } from './connection.provider';

@Module({
  providers: [Connection],
})
export class DatabaseModule {
  static forRoot(entities = [], options?): DynamicModule {
    const providers = createDatabaseProviders(options, entities);
    return {
      module: DatabaseModule,
      providers: providers,
      exports: providers,
    };
  }
}
@@switch
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { createDatabaseProviders } from './database.providers';
import { Connection } from './connection.provider';

@Module({
  providers: [Connection],
})
export class DatabaseModule {
  static forRoot(entities = [], options?) {
    const providers = createDatabaseProviders(options, entities);
    return {
      module: DatabaseModule,
      providers: providers,
      exports: providers,
    };
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** The `forRoot()` method may return a dynamic module either synchronously or asynchronously (i.e., via a `Promise`).

This module defines the `Connection` provider by default (in the `@Module()` decorator metadata), but additionally - depending on the `entities` and `options` objects passed into the `forRoot()` method - exposes a collection of providers, for example, repositories. Note that the properties returned by the dynamic module **extend** (rather than override) the base module metadata defined in the `@Module()` decorator. That's how both the statically declared `Connection` provider **and** the dynamically generated repository providers are exported from the module.

If you want to register a dynamic module in the global scope, set the `global` property to `true`.

```typescript
{
  global: true,
  module: DatabaseModule,
  providers: providers,
  exports: providers,
}
```

> warning **Warning** As mentioned above, making everything global **is not a good design decision**.

The `DatabaseModule` can be imported and configured in the following manner:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { DatabaseModule } from './database/database.module';
import { User } from './users/entities/user.entity';

@Module({
  imports: [DatabaseModule.forRoot([User])],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

If you want to in turn re-export a dynamic module, you can omit the `forRoot()` method call in the exports array:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { DatabaseModule } from './database/database.module';
import { User } from './users/entities/user.entity';

@Module({
  imports: [DatabaseModule.forRoot([User])],
  exports: [DatabaseModule],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The [Dynamic modules](/fundamentals/dynamic-modules) chapter covers this topic in greater detail, and includes a [working example](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/25-dynamic-modules).
### Middleware <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/middleware"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="middleware" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Middleware is a function which is called **before** the route handler. Middleware functions have access to the [request](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req) and [response](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res) objects, and the `next()` middleware function in the application‚Äôs request-response cycle. The **next** middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named `next`.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/Middlewares_1.png" /></figure>

Nest middleware are, by default, equivalent to [express](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) middleware. The following description from the official express documentation describes the capabilities of middleware:

<blockquote class="external">
  Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
  <ul>
    <li>execute any code.</li>
    <li>make changes to the request and the response objects.</li>
    <li>end the request-response cycle.</li>
    <li>call the next middleware function in the stack.</li>
    <li>if the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call <code>next()</code> to
      pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

You implement custom Nest middleware in either a function, or in a class with an `@Injectable()` decorator. The class should implement the `NestMiddleware` interface, while the function does not have any special requirements. Let's start by implementing a simple middleware feature using the class method.

```typescript
@@filename(logger.middleware)
import { Injectable, NestMiddleware } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

@Injectable()
export class LoggerMiddleware implements NestMiddleware {
  use(req: Request, res: Response, next: Function) {
    console.log('Request...');
    next();
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class LoggerMiddleware {
  use(req, res, next) {
    console.log('Request...');
    next();
  }
}
```

#### Dependency injection

Nest middleware fully supports Dependency Injection. Just as with providers and controllers, they are able to **inject dependencies** that are available within the same module. As usual, this is done through the `constructor`.

#### Applying middleware

There is no place for middleware in the `@Module()` decorator. Instead, we set them up using the `configure()` method of the module class. Modules that include middleware have to implement the `NestModule` interface. Let's set up the `LoggerMiddleware` at the `AppModule` level.

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module, NestModule, MiddlewareConsumer } from '@nestjs/common';
import { LoggerMiddleware } from './common/middleware/logger.middleware';
import { CatsModule } from './cats/cats.module';

@Module({
  imports: [CatsModule],
})
export class AppModule implements NestModule {
  configure(consumer: MiddlewareConsumer) {
    consumer
      .apply(LoggerMiddleware)
      .forRoutes('cats');
  }
}
@@switch
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { LoggerMiddleware } from './common/middleware/logger.middleware';
import { CatsModule } from './cats/cats.module';

@Module({
  imports: [CatsModule],
})
export class AppModule {
  configure(consumer) {
    consumer
      .apply(LoggerMiddleware)
      .forRoutes('cats');
  }
}
```

In the above example we have set up the `LoggerMiddleware` for the `/cats` route handlers that were previously defined inside the `CatsController`. We may also further restrict a middleware to a particular request method by passing an object containing the route `path` and request `method` to the `forRoutes()` method when configuring the middleware. In the example below, notice that we import the `RequestMethod` enum to reference the desired request method type.

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module, NestModule, RequestMethod, MiddlewareConsumer } from '@nestjs/common';
import { LoggerMiddleware } from './common/middleware/logger.middleware';
import { CatsModule } from './cats/cats.module';

@Module({
  imports: [CatsModule],
})
export class AppModule implements NestModule {
  configure(consumer: MiddlewareConsumer) {
    consumer
      .apply(LoggerMiddleware)
      .forRoutes({ path: 'cats', method: RequestMethod.GET });
  }
}
@@switch
import { Module, RequestMethod } from '@nestjs/common';
import { LoggerMiddleware } from './common/middleware/logger.middleware';
import { CatsModule } from './cats/cats.module';

@Module({
  imports: [CatsModule],
})
export class AppModule {
  configure(consumer) {
    consumer
      .apply(LoggerMiddleware)
      .forRoutes({ path: 'cats', method: RequestMethod.GET });
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** The `configure()` method can be made asynchronous using `async/await` (e.g., you can `await` completion of an asynchronous operation inside the `configure()` method body).

#### Route wildcards

Pattern based routes are supported as well. For instance, the asterisk is used as a **wildcard**, and will match any combination of characters:

```typescript
forRoutes({ path: 'ab*cd', method: RequestMethod.ALL });
```

The `'ab*cd'` route path will match `abcd`, `ab_cd`, `abecd`, and so on. The characters `?`, `+`, `*`, and `()` may be used in a route path, and are subsets of their regular expression counterparts. The hyphen ( `-`) and the dot (`.`) are interpreted literally by string-based paths.

> warning **Warning** The `fastify` package uses the latest version of the `path-to-regexp` package, which no longer supports wildcard asterisks `*`. Instead, you must use parameters (e.g., `(.*)`, `:splat*`).

#### Middleware consumer

The `MiddlewareConsumer` is a helper class. It provides several built-in methods to manage middleware. All of them can be simply **chained** in the [fluent style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface). The `forRoutes()` method can take a single string, multiple strings, a `RouteInfo` object, a controller class and even multiple controller classes. In most cases you'll probably just pass a list of **controllers** separated by commas. Below is an example with a single controller:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module, NestModule, MiddlewareConsumer } from '@nestjs/common';
import { LoggerMiddleware } from './common/middleware/logger.middleware';
import { CatsModule } from './cats/cats.module';
import { CatsController } from './cats/cats.controller.ts';

@Module({
  imports: [CatsModule],
})
export class AppModule implements NestModule {
  configure(consumer: MiddlewareConsumer) {
    consumer
      .apply(LoggerMiddleware)
      .forRoutes(CatsController);
  }
}
@@switch
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { LoggerMiddleware } from './common/middleware/logger.middleware';
import { CatsModule } from './cats/cats.module';
import { CatsController } from './cats/cats.controller.ts';

@Module({
  imports: [CatsModule],
})
export class AppModule {
  configure(consumer) {
    consumer
      .apply(LoggerMiddleware)
      .forRoutes(CatsController);
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** The `apply()` method may either take a single middleware, or multiple arguments to specify <a href="/middleware#multiple-middleware">multiple middlewares</a>.

#### Excluding routes

At times we want to **exclude** certain routes from having the middleware applied. We can easily exclude certain routes with the `exclude()` method. This method can take a single string, multiple strings, or a `RouteInfo` object identifying routes to be excluded, as shown below:

```typescript
consumer
  .apply(LoggerMiddleware)
  .exclude(
    { path: 'cats', method: RequestMethod.GET },
    { path: 'cats', method: RequestMethod.POST },
    'cats/(.*)',
  )
  .forRoutes(CatsController);
```

> info **Hint** The `exclude()` method supports wildcard parameters using the [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp#parameters) package.

With the example above, `LoggerMiddleware` will be bound to all routes defined inside `CatsController` **except** the three passed to the `exclude()` method.

<app-banner-shop></app-banner-shop>

#### Functional middleware

The `LoggerMiddleware` class we've been using is quite simple. It has no members, no additional methods, and no dependencies. Why can't we just define it in a simple function instead of a class? In fact, we can. This type of middleware is called **functional middleware**. Let's transform the logger middleware from class-based into functional middleware to illustrate the difference:

```typescript
@@filename(logger.middleware)
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

export function logger(req: Request, res: Response, next: Function) {
  console.log(`Request...`);
  next();
};
@@switch
export function logger(req, res, next) {
  console.log(`Request...`);
  next();
};
```

And use it within the `AppModule`:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
consumer
  .apply(logger)
  .forRoutes(CatsController);
```

> info **Hint** Consider using the simpler **functional middleware** alternative any time your middleware doesn't need any dependencies.

#### Multiple middleware

As mentioned above, in order to bind multiple middleware that are executed sequentially, simply provide a comma separated list inside the `apply()` method:

```typescript
consumer.apply(cors(), helmet(), logger).forRoutes(CatsController);
```

#### Global middleware

If we want to bind middleware to every registered route at once, we can use the `use()` method that is supplied by the `INestApplication` instance:

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
app.use(logger);
await app.listen(3000);
```
### Exception filters <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/exception-filters"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="exception-filters-overview" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Nest comes with a built-in **exceptions layer** which is responsible for processing all unhandled exceptions across an application. When an exception is not handled by your application code, it is caught by this layer, which then automatically sends an appropriate user-friendly response.

<figure>
  <img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/Filter_1.png" />
</figure>

Out of the box, this action is performed by a built-in **global exception filter**, which handles exceptions of type `HttpException` (and subclasses of it). When an exception is **unrecognized** (is neither `HttpException` nor a class that inherits from `HttpException`), the built-in exception filter generates the following default JSON response:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 500,
  "message": "Internal server error"
}
```

#### Throwing standard exceptions

Nest provides a built-in `HttpException` class, exposed from the `@nestjs/common` package. For typical HTTP REST/GraphQL API based applications, it's best practice to send standard HTTP response objects when certain error conditions occur.

For example, in the `CatsController`, we have a `findAll()` method (a `GET` route handler). Let's assume that this route handler throws an exception for some reason. To demonstrate this, we'll hard-code it as follows:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Get()
async findAll() {
  throw new HttpException('Forbidden', HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN);
}
```

> info **Hint** We used the `HttpStatus` here. This is a helper enum imported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

When the client calls this endpoint, the response looks like this:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "message": "Forbidden"
}
```

The `HttpException` constructor takes two required arguments which determine the
response:

- The `response` argument defines the JSON response body. It can be a `string`
  or an `object` as described below.
- The `status` argument defines the [HTTP status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

By default, the JSON response body contains two properties:

- `statusCode`: defaults to the HTTP status code provided in the `status` argument
- `message`: a short description of the HTTP error based on the `status`

To override just the message portion of the JSON response body, supply a string
in the `response` argument. To override the entire JSON response body, pass an object in the `response` argument. Nest will serialize the object and return it as the JSON response body.

The second constructor argument - `status` - should be a valid HTTP status code.
Best practice is to use the `HttpStatus` enum imported from `@nestjs/common`.

Here's an example overriding the entire response body:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Get()
async findAll() {
  throw new HttpException({
    status: HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN,
    error: 'This is a custom message',
  }, HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN);
}
```

Using the above, this is how the response would look:

```json
{
  "status": 403,
  "error": "This is a custom message"
}
```

#### Custom exceptions

In many cases, you will not need to write custom exceptions, and can use the built-in Nest HTTP exception, as described in the next section. If you do need to create customized exceptions, it's good practice to create your own **exceptions hierarchy**, where your custom exceptions inherit from the base `HttpException` class. With this approach, Nest will recognize your exceptions, and automatically take care of the error responses. Let's implement such a custom exception:

```typescript
@@filename(forbidden.exception)
export class ForbiddenException extends HttpException {
  constructor() {
    super('Forbidden', HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN);
  }
}
```

Since `ForbiddenException` extends the base `HttpException`, it will work seamlessly with the built-in exception handler, and therefore we can use it inside the `findAll()` method.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Get()
async findAll() {
  throw new ForbiddenException();
}
```

#### Built-in HTTP exceptions

Nest provides a set of standard exceptions that inherit from the base `HttpException`. These are exposed from the `@nestjs/common` package, and represent many of the most common HTTP exceptions:

- `BadRequestException`
- `UnauthorizedException`
- `NotFoundException`
- `ForbiddenException`
- `NotAcceptableException`
- `RequestTimeoutException`
- `ConflictException`
- `GoneException`
- `HttpVersionNotSupportedException`
- `PayloadTooLargeException`
- `UnsupportedMediaTypeException`
- `UnprocessableEntityException`
- `InternalServerErrorException`
- `NotImplementedException`
- `ImATeapotException`
- `MethodNotAllowedException`
- `BadGatewayException`
- `ServiceUnavailableException`
- `GatewayTimeoutException`
- `PreconditionFailedException`

#### Exception filters

While the base (built-in) exception filter can automatically handle many cases for you, you may want **full control** over the exceptions layer. For example, you may want to add logging or use a different JSON schema based on some dynamic factors. **Exception filters** are designed for exactly this purpose. They let you control the exact flow of control and the content of the response sent back to the client.

Let's create an exception filter that is responsible for catching exceptions which are an instance of the `HttpException` class, and implementing custom response logic for them. To do this, we'll need to access the underlying platform `Request` and `Response` objects. We'll access the `Request` object so we can pull out the original `url` and include that in the logging information. We'll use the `Response` object to take direct control of the response that is sent, using the `response.json()` method.

```typescript
@@filename(http-exception.filter)
import { ExceptionFilter, Catch, ArgumentsHost, HttpException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

@Catch(HttpException)
export class HttpExceptionFilter implements ExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception: HttpException, host: ArgumentsHost) {
    const ctx = host.switchToHttp();
    const response = ctx.getResponse<Response>();
    const request = ctx.getRequest<Request>();
    const status = exception.getStatus();

    response
      .status(status)
      .json({
        statusCode: status,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        path: request.url,
      });
  }
}
@@switch
import { Catch, HttpException } from '@nestjs/common';

@Catch(HttpException)
export class HttpExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception, host) {
    const ctx = host.switchToHttp();
    const response = ctx.getResponse();
    const request = ctx.getRequest();
    const status = exception.getStatus();

    response
      .status(status)
      .json({
        statusCode: status,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        path: request.url,
      });
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** All exception filters should implement the generic `ExceptionFilter<T>` interface. This requires you to provide the `catch(exception: T, host: ArgumentsHost)` method with its indicated signature. `T` indicates the type of the exception.

The `@Catch(HttpException)` decorator binds the required metadata to the exception filter, telling Nest that this particular filter is looking for exceptions of type `HttpException` and nothing else. The `@Catch()` decorator may take a single parameter, or a comma-separated list. This lets you set up the filter for several types of exceptions at once.

#### Arguments host

Let's look at the parameters of the `catch()` method. The `exception` parameter is the exception object currently being processed. The `host` parameter is an `ArgumentsHost` object. `ArgumentsHost` is a powerful utility object that we'll examine further in the [execution context chapter](/fundamentals/execution-context)\*. In this code sample, we use it to obtain a reference to the `Request` and `Response` objects that are being passed to the original request handler (in the controller where the exception originates). In this code sample, we've used some helper methods on `ArgumentsHost` to get the desired `Request` and `Response` objects. Learn more about `ArgumentsHost` [here](/fundamentals/execution-context).

\*The reason for this level of abstraction is that `ArgumentsHost` functions in all contexts (e.g., the HTTP server context we're working with now, but also Microservices and WebSockets). In the execution context chapter we'll see how we can access the appropriate <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/execution-context#host-methods">underlying arguments</a> for **any** execution context with the power of `ArgumentsHost` and its helper functions. This will allow us to write generic exception filters that operate across all contexts.

<app-banner-courses></app-banner-courses>

#### Binding filters

Let's tie our new `HttpExceptionFilter` to the `CatsController`'s `create()` method.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Post()
@UseFilters(new HttpExceptionFilter())
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  throw new ForbiddenException();
}
@@switch
@Post()
@UseFilters(new HttpExceptionFilter())
@Bind(Body())
async create(createCatDto) {
  throw new ForbiddenException();
}
```

> info **Hint** The `@UseFilters()` decorator is imported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

We have used the `@UseFilters()` decorator here. Similar to the `@Catch()` decorator, it can take a single filter instance, or a comma-separated list of filter instances. Here, we created the instance of `HttpExceptionFilter` in place. Alternatively, you may pass the class (instead of an instance), leaving responsibility for instantiation to the framework, and enabling **dependency injection**.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Post()
@UseFilters(HttpExceptionFilter)
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  throw new ForbiddenException();
}
@@switch
@Post()
@UseFilters(HttpExceptionFilter)
@Bind(Body())
async create(createCatDto) {
  throw new ForbiddenException();
}
```

> info **Hint** Prefer applying filters by using classes instead of instances when possible. It reduces **memory usage** since Nest can easily reuse instances of the same class across your entire module.

In the example above, the `HttpExceptionFilter` is applied only to the single `create()` route handler, making it method-scoped. Exception filters can be scoped at different levels: method-scoped, controller-scoped, or global-scoped. For example, to set up a filter as controller-scoped, you would do the following:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@UseFilters(new HttpExceptionFilter())
export class CatsController {}
```

This construction sets up the `HttpExceptionFilter` for every route handler defined inside the `CatsController`.

To create a global-scoped filter, you would do the following:

```typescript
@@filename(main)
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.useGlobalFilters(new HttpExceptionFilter());
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

> warning **Warning** The `useGlobalFilters()` method does not set up filters for gateways or hybrid applications.

Global-scoped filters are used across the whole application, for every controller and every route handler. In terms of dependency injection, global filters registered from outside of any module (with `useGlobalFilters()` as in the example above) cannot inject dependencies since this is done outside the context of any module. In order to solve this issue, you can register a global-scoped filter **directly from any module** using the following construction:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { APP_FILTER } from '@nestjs/core';

@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: APP_FILTER,
      useClass: HttpExceptionFilter,
    },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> info **Hint** When using this approach to perform dependency injection for the filter, note that regardless of the module where this construction is employed, the filter is, in fact, global. Where should this be done? Choose the module where the filter (`HttpExceptionFilter` in the example above) is defined. Also, `useClass` is not the only way of dealing with custom provider registration. Learn more [here](/fundamentals/custom-providers).

You can add as many filters with this technique as needed; simply add each to the providers array.

#### Catch everything

In order to catch **every** unhandled exception (regardless of the exception type), leave the `@Catch()` decorator's parameter list empty, e.g., `@Catch()`.

```typescript
import {
  ExceptionFilter,
  Catch,
  ArgumentsHost,
  HttpException,
  HttpStatus,
} from '@nestjs/common';

@Catch()
export class AllExceptionsFilter implements ExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception: unknown, host: ArgumentsHost) {
    const ctx = host.switchToHttp();
    const response = ctx.getResponse();
    const request = ctx.getRequest();

    const status =
      exception instanceof HttpException
        ? exception.getStatus()
        : HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR;

    response.status(status).json({
      statusCode: status,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      path: request.url,
    });
  }
}
```

In the example above the filter will catch each exception thrown, regardless of its type (class).

#### Inheritance

Typically, you'll create fully customized exception filters crafted to fulfill your application requirements. However, there might be use-cases when you would like to simply extend the built-in default **global exception filter**, and override the behavior based on certain factors.

In order to delegate exception processing to the base filter, you need to extend `BaseExceptionFilter` and call the inherited `catch()` method.

```typescript
@@filename(all-exceptions.filter)
import { Catch, ArgumentsHost } from '@nestjs/common';
import { BaseExceptionFilter } from '@nestjs/core';

@Catch()
export class AllExceptionsFilter extends BaseExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception: unknown, host: ArgumentsHost) {
    super.catch(exception, host);
  }
}
@@switch
import { Catch } from '@nestjs/common';
import { BaseExceptionFilter } from '@nestjs/core';

@Catch()
export class AllExceptionsFilter extends BaseExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception, host) {
    super.catch(exception, host);
  }
}
```

> warning **Warning** Method-scoped and Controller-scoped filters that extend the `BaseExceptionFilter` should not be instantiated with `new`. Instead, let the framework instantiate them automatically.

The above implementation is just a shell demonstrating the approach. Your implementation of the extended exception filter would include your tailored **business** logic (e.g., handling various conditions).

Global filters **can** extend the base filter. This can be done in either of two ways.

The first method is to inject the `HttpServer` reference when instantiating the custom global filter:

```typescript
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

  const { httpAdapter } = app.get(HttpAdapterHost);
  app.useGlobalFilters(new AllExceptionsFilter(httpAdapter));

  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

The second method is to use the `APP_FILTER` token <a href="exception-filters#binding-filters">as shown here</a>.
### Pipes <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/pipes"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="pipes-ov" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

A pipe is a class annotated with the `@Injectable()` decorator. Pipes should implement the `PipeTransform` interface.

</figure>

Pipes have two typical use cases:

- **transformation**: transform input data to the desired form (e.g., from string to integer)
- **validation**: evaluate input data and if valid, simply pass it through unchanged; otherwise, throw an exception when the data is incorrect

In both cases, pipes operate on the `arguments` being processed by a <a href="controllers#route-parameters">controller route handler</a>. Nest interposes a pipe just before a method is invoked, and the pipe receives the arguments destined for the method and operates on them. Any transformation or validation operation takes place at that time, after which the route handler is invoked with any (potentially) transformed arguments.

Nest comes with a number of built-in pipes that you can use out-of-the-box. You can also build your own custom pipes. In this chapter, we'll introduce the built-in pipes and show how to bind them to route handlers. We'll then examine several custom-built pipes to show how you can build one from scratch.

> info **Hint** Pipes run inside the exceptions zone. This means that when a Pipe throws an exception it is handled by the exceptions layer (global exceptions filter and any [exceptions filters](/exception-filters) that are applied to the current context). Given the above, it should be clear that when an exception is thrown in a Pipe, no controller method is subsequently executed. This gives you a best-practice technique for validating data coming into the application from external sources at the system boundary.

#### Built-in pipes

Nest comes with six pipes available out-of-the-box:

- `ValidationPipe`
- `ParseIntPipe`
- `ParseBoolPipe`
- `ParseArrayPipe`
- `ParseUUIDPipe`
- `DefaultValuePipe`

They're exported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

Let's take a quick look at using `ParseIntPipe`. This is an example of the **transformation** use case, where the pipe ensures that a method handler parameter is converted to a JavaScript integer (or throws an exception if the conversion fails). Later in this chapter, we'll show a simple custom implementation for a `ParseIntPipe`. The example techniques below also apply to the other built-in transformation pipes (`ParseBoolPipe`, `ParseArrayPipe` and `ParseUUIDPipe`, which we'll refer to as the `Parse*` pipes in this chapter).

#### Binding pipes

To use a pipe, we need to bind an instance of the pipe class to the appropriate context. In our `ParseIntPipe` example, we want to associate the pipe with a particular route handler method, and make sure it runs before the method is called. We do so with the following construct, which we'll refer to as binding the pipe at the method parameter level:

```typescript
@Get(':id')
async findOne(@Param('id', ParseIntPipe) id: number) {
  return this.catsService.findOne(id);
}
```

This ensures that one of the following two conditions is true: either the parameter we receive in the `findOne()` method is a number (as expected in our call to `this.catsService.findOne()`), or an exception is thrown before the route handler is called.

For example, assume the route is called like:

```bash
GET localhost:3000/abc
```

Nest will throw an exception like this:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Validation failed (numeric string is expected)",
  "error": "Bad Request"
}
```

The exception will prevent the body of the `findOne()` method from executing.

In the example above, we pass a class (`ParseIntPipe`), not an instance, leaving responsibility for instantiation to the framework and enabling dependency injection. As with pipes and guards, we can instead pass an in-place instance. Passing an in-place instance is useful if we want to customize the built-in pipe's behavior by passing options:

```typescript
@Get(':id')
async findOne(
  @Param('id', new ParseIntPipe({ errorHttpStatusCode: HttpStatus.NOT_ACCEPTABLE }))
  id: number,
) {
  return this.catsService.findOne(id);
}
```

Binding the other transformation pipes (all of the **Parse\*** pipes) works similarly. These pipes all work in the context of validating route parameters, query string parameters and request body values.

For example with a query string parameter:

```typescript
@Get()
async findOne(@Query('id', ParseIntPipe) id: number) {
  return this.catsService.findOne(id);
}
```

Here's an example of using the `ParseUUIDPipe` to parse a string parameter and validate if it is a UUID.

```typescript
@@filename()
@Get(':uuid')
async findOne(@Param('uuid', new ParseUUIDPipe()) uuid: string) {
  return this.catsService.findOne(uuid);
}
@@switch
@Get(':uuid')
@Bind(Param('uuid', new ParseUUIDPipe()))
async findOne(uuid) {
  return this.catsService.findOne(uuid);
}
```

> info **Hint** When using `ParseUUIDPipe()` you are parsing UUID in version 3, 4 or 5, if you only require a specific version of UUID you can pass a version in the pipe options.

Above we've seen examples of binding the various `Parse*` family of built-in pipes. Binding validation pipes is a little bit different; we'll discuss that in the following section.

> info **Hint** Also, see [Validation techniques](/techniques/validation) for extensive examples of validation pipes.

#### Custom pipes

As mentioned, you can build your own custom pipes. While Nest provides a robust built-in `ParseIntPipe` and `ValidationPipe`, let's build simple custom versions of each from scratch to see how custom pipes are constructed.

We start with a simple `ValidationPipe`. Initially, we'll have it simply take an input value and immediately return the same value, behaving like an identity function.

```typescript
@@filename(validation.pipe)
import { PipeTransform, Injectable, ArgumentMetadata } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class ValidationPipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: any, metadata: ArgumentMetadata) {
    return value;
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class ValidationPipe {
  transform(value, metadata) {
    return value;
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** `PipeTransform<T, R>` is a generic interface that must be implemented by any pipe. The generic interface uses `T` to indicate the type of the input `value`, and `R` to indicate the return type of the `transform()` method.

Every pipe must implement the `transform()` method to fulfill the `PipeTransform` interface contract. This method has two parameters:

- `value`
- `metadata`

The `value` parameter is the currently processed method argument (before it is received by the route handling method), and `metadata` is the currently processed method argument's metadata. The metadata object has these properties:

```typescript
export interface ArgumentMetadata {
  type: 'body' | 'query' | 'param' | 'custom';
  metatype?: Type<unknown>;
  data?: string;
}
```

These properties describe the currently processed argument.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>type</code>
    </td>
    <td>Indicates whether the argument is a body
      <code>@Body()</code>, query
      <code>@Query()</code>, param
      <code>@Param()</code>, or a custom parameter (read more
      <a routerLink="/custom-decorators">here</a>).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>metatype</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      Provides the metatype of the argument, for example,
      <code>String</code>. Note: the value is
      <code>undefined</code> if you either omit a type declaration in the route handler method signature, or use vanilla JavaScript.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>data</code>
    </td>
    <td>The string passed to the decorator, for example
      <code>@Body('string')</code>. It's
      <code>undefined</code> if you leave the decorator parenthesis empty.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

> warning **Warning** TypeScript interfaces disappear during transpilation. Thus, if a method parameter's type is declared as an interface instead of a class, the `metatype` value will be `Object`.

#### Schema based validation

Let's make our validation pipe a little more useful. Take a closer look at the `create()` method of the `CatsController`, where we probably would like to ensure that the post body object is valid before attempting to run our service method.

```typescript
@@filename()
@Post()
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
@@switch
@Post()
async create(@Body() createCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
```

Let's focus in on the `createCatDto` body parameter. Its type is `CreateCatDto`:

```typescript
@@filename(create-cat.dto)
export class CreateCatDto {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  breed: string;
}
```

We want to ensure that any incoming request to the create method contains a valid body. So we have to validate the three members of the `createCatDto` object. We could do this inside the route handler method, but doing so is not ideal as it would break the **single responsibility rule** (SRP).

Another approach could be to create a **validator class** and delegate the task there. This has the disadvantage that we would have to remember to call this validator at the beginning of each method.

How about creating validation middleware? This could work, but unfortunately it's not possible to create **generic middleware** which can be used across all contexts across the whole application. This is because middleware is unaware of the **execution context**, including the handler that will be called and any of its parameters.

This is, of course, exactly the use case for which pipes are designed. So let's go ahead and refine our validation pipe.

<app-banner-courses></app-banner-courses>

#### Object schema validation

There are several approaches available for doing object validation in a clean, [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) way. One common approach is to use **schema-based** validation. Let's go ahead and try that approach.

The [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) library allows you to create schemas in a straightforward way, with a readable API. Let's build a validation pipe that makes use of Joi-based schemas.

Start by installing the required package:

```bash
$ npm install --save @hapi/joi
$ npm install --save-dev @types/hapi__joi
```

In the code sample below, we create a simple class that takes a schema as a `constructor` argument. We then apply the `schema.validate()` method, which validates our incoming argument against the provided schema.

As noted earlier, a **validation pipe** either returns the value unchanged, or throws an exception.

In the next section, you'll see how we supply the appropriate schema for a given controller method using the `@UsePipes()` decorator. Doing so makes our validation pipe re-usable across contexts, just as we set out to do.

```typescript
@@filename()
import { PipeTransform, Injectable, ArgumentMetadata, BadRequestException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ObjectSchema } from '@hapi/joi';

@Injectable()
export class JoiValidationPipe implements PipeTransform {
  constructor(private schema: ObjectSchema) {}

  transform(value: any, metadata: ArgumentMetadata) {
    const { error } = this.schema.validate(value);
    if (error) {
      throw new BadRequestException('Validation failed');
    }
    return value;
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable, BadRequestException } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class JoiValidationPipe {
  constructor(schema) {
    this.schema = schema;
  }

  transform(value, metadata) {
    const { error } = this.schema.validate(value);
    if (error) {
      throw new BadRequestException('Validation failed');
    }
    return value;
  }
}
```

#### Binding validation pipes

Earlier, we saw how to bind transformation pipes (like `ParseIntPipe` and the rest of the `Parse*` pipes).

Binding validation pipes is also very straightforward.

In this case, we want to bind the pipe at the method call level. In our current example, we need to do the following to use the `JoiValidationPipe`:

1. Create an instance of the `JoiValidationPipe`
2. Pass the context-specific Joi schema in the class constructor of the pipe
3. Bind the pipe to the method

We do that using the `@UsePipes()` decorator as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename()
@Post()
@UsePipes(new JoiValidationPipe(createCatSchema))
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
@@switch
@Post()
@Bind(Body())
@UsePipes(new JoiValidationPipe(createCatSchema))
async create(createCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
```

> info **Hint** The `@UsePipes()` decorator is imported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

#### Class validator

> warning **Warning** The techniques in this section require TypeScript, and are not available if your app is written using vanilla JavaScript.

Let's look at an alternate implementation for our validation technique.

Nest works well with the [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator) library. This powerful library allows you to use decorator-based validation. Decorator-based validation is extremely powerful, especially when combined with Nest's **Pipe** capabilities since we have access to the `metatype` of the processed property. Before we start, we need to install the required packages:

```bash
$ npm i --save class-validator class-transformer
```

Once these are installed, we can add a few decorators to the `CreateCatDto` class. Here we see a significant advantage of this technique: the `CreateCatDto` class remains the single source of truth for our Post body object (rather than having to create a separate validation class).

```typescript
@@filename(create-cat.dto)
import { IsString, IsInt } from 'class-validator';

export class CreateCatDto {
  @IsString()
  name: string;

  @IsInt()
  age: number;

  @IsString()
  breed: string;
}
```

> info **Hint** Read more about the class-validator decorators [here](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator#usage).

Now we can create a `ValidationPipe` class that uses these annotations.

```typescript
@@filename(validation.pipe)
import { PipeTransform, Injectable, ArgumentMetadata, BadRequestException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { validate } from 'class-validator';
import { plainToClass } from 'class-transformer';

@Injectable()
export class ValidationPipe implements PipeTransform<any> {
  async transform(value: any, { metatype }: ArgumentMetadata) {
    if (!metatype || !this.toValidate(metatype)) {
      return value;
    }
    const object = plainToClass(metatype, value);
    const errors = await validate(object);
    if (errors.length > 0) {
      throw new BadRequestException('Validation failed');
    }
    return value;
  }

  private toValidate(metatype: Function): boolean {
    const types: Function[] = [String, Boolean, Number, Array, Object];
    return !types.includes(metatype);
  }
}
```

> warning **Notice** Above, we have used the [class-transformer](https://github.com/typestack/class-transformer) library. It's made by the same author as the **class-validator** library, and as a result, they play very well together.

Let's go through this code. First, note that the `transform()` method is marked as `async`. This is possible because Nest supports both synchronous and **asynchronous** pipes. We make this method `async` because some of the class-validator validations [can be async](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator#custom-validation-classes) (utilize Promises).

Next note that we are using destructuring to extract the metatype field (extracting just this member from an `ArgumentMetadata`) into our `metatype` parameter. This is just shorthand for getting the full `ArgumentMetadata` and then having an additional statement to assign the metatype variable.

Next, note the helper function `toValidate()`. It's responsible for bypassing the validation step when the current argument being processed is a native JavaScript type (these can't have validation decorators attached, so there's no reason to run them through the validation step).

Next, we use the class-transformer function `plainToClass()` to transform our plain JavaScript argument object into a typed object so that we can apply validation. The reason we must do this is that the incoming post body object, when deserialized from the network request, does **not have any type information** (this is the way the underlying platform, such as Express, works). Class-validator needs to use the validation decorators we defined for our DTO earlier, so we need to perform this transformation to treat the incoming body as an appropriately decorated object, not just a plain vanilla object.

Finally, as noted earlier, since this is a **validation pipe** it either returns the value unchanged, or throws an exception.

The last step is to bind the `ValidationPipe`. Pipes can be parameter-scoped, method-scoped, controller-scoped, or global-scoped. Earlier, with our Joi-based validation pipe, we saw an example of binding the pipe at the method level.
In the example below, we'll bind the pipe instance to the route handler `@Body()` decorator so that our pipe is called to validate the post body.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Post()
async create(
  @Body(new ValidationPipe()) createCatDto: CreateCatDto,
) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
```

Parameter-scoped pipes are useful when the validation logic concerns only one specified parameter.

#### Global scoped pipes

Since the `ValidationPipe` was created to be as generic as possible, we can realize it's full utility by setting it up as a **global-scoped** pipe so that it is applied to every route handler across the entire application.

```typescript
@@filename(main)
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe());
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

> warning **Notice** In the case of <a href="faq/hybrid-application">hybrid apps</a> the `useGlobalPipes()` method doesn't set up pipes for gateways and micro services. For "standard" (non-hybrid) microservice apps, `useGlobalPipes()` does mount pipes globally.

Global pipes are used across the whole application, for every controller and every route handler.

Note that in terms of dependency injection, global pipes registered from outside of any module (with `useGlobalPipes()` as in the example above) cannot inject dependencies since the binding has been done outside the context of any module. In order to solve this issue, you can set up a global pipe **directly from any module** using the following construction:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { APP_PIPE } from '@nestjs/core';

@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: APP_PIPE,
      useClass: ValidationPipe,
    },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> info **Hint** When using this approach to perform dependency injection for the pipe, note that regardless of the module where this construction is employed, the pipe is, in fact, global. Where should this be done? Choose the module where the pipe (`ValidationPipe` in the example above) is defined. Also, `useClass` is not the only way of dealing with custom provider registration. Learn more [here](/fundamentals/custom-providers).

#### Transformation use case

Validation isn't the only use case for custom pipes. At the beginning of this chapter, we mentioned that a pipe can also **transform** the input data to the desired format. This is possible because the value returned from the `transform` function completely overrides the previous value of the argument.

When is this useful? Consider that sometimes the data passed from the client needs to undergo some change - for example converting a string to an integer - before it can be properly handled by the route handler method. Furthermore, some required data fields may be missing, and we would like to apply default values. **Transformation pipes** can perform these functions by interposing a processing function between the client request and the request handler.

Here's a simple `ParseIntPipe` which is responsible for parsing a string into an integer value. (As noted above, Nest has a built-in `ParseIntPipe` that is more sophisticated; we include this as a simple example of a custom transformation pipe).

```typescript
@@filename(parse-int.pipe)
import { PipeTransform, Injectable, ArgumentMetadata, BadRequestException } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class ParseIntPipe implements PipeTransform<string, number> {
  transform(value: string, metadata: ArgumentMetadata): number {
    const val = parseInt(value, 10);
    if (isNaN(val)) {
      throw new BadRequestException('Validation failed');
    }
    return val;
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable, BadRequestException } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class ParseIntPipe {
  transform(value, metadata) {
    const val = parseInt(value, 10);
    if (isNaN(val)) {
      throw new BadRequestException('Validation failed');
    }
    return val;
  }
}
```

We can then bind this pipe to the selected param as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename()
@Get(':id')
async findOne(@Param('id', new ParseIntPipe()) id) {
  return this.catsService.findOne(id);
}
@@switch
@Get(':id')
@Bind(Param('id', new ParseIntPipe()))
async findOne(id) {
  return this.catsService.findOne(id);
}
```

Another useful transformation case would be to select an **existing user** entity from the database using an id supplied in the request:

```typescript
@@filename()
@Get(':id')
findOne(@Param('id', UserByIdPipe) userEntity: UserEntity) {
  return userEntity;
}
@@switch
@Get(':id')
@Bind(Param('id', UserByIdPipe))
findOne(userEntity) {
  return userEntity;
}
```

We leave the implementation of this pipe to the reader, but note that like all other transformation pipes, it receives an input value (an `id`) and returns an output value (a `UserEntity` object). This can make your code more declarative and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) by abstracting boilerplate code out of your handler and into a common pipe.

#### Providing defaults

`Parse*` pipes expect a parameter's value to be defined. They throw an exception upon receiving `null` or `undefined` values. To allow an endpoint to handle missing querystring parameter values, we have to provide a default value to be injected before the `Parse*` pipes operate on these values. The `DefaultValuePipe` serves that purpose. Simply instantiate a `DefaultValuePipe` in the `@Query()` decorator before the relevant `Parse*` pipe, as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename()
@Get()
async findAll(
  @Query('activeOnly', new DefaultValuePipe(false), ParseBoolPipe) activeOnly: boolean,
  @Query('page', new DefaultValuePipe(0), ParseIntPipe) page: number,
) {
  return this.catsService.findAll({ activeOnly, page });
}
```

#### The built-in ValidationPipe

As a reminder, you don't have to build a generic validation pipe on your own since the `ValidationPipe` is provided by Nest out-of-the-box. The built-in `ValidationPipe` offers more options than the sample we built in this chapter, which has been kept basic for the sake of illustrating the mechanics of a custom-built pipe. You can find full details, along with lots of examples [here](/techniques/validation).
### Guards <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/guards"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="guards-ov" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

A guard is a class annotated with the `@Injectable()` decorator. Guards should implement the `CanActivate` interface.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/Guards_1.png" /></figure>

Guards have a **single responsibility**. They determine whether a given request will be handled by the route handler or not, depending on certain conditions (like permissions, roles, ACLs, etc.) present at run-time. This is often referred to as **authorization**. Authorization (and its cousin, **authentication**, with which it usually collaborates) has typically been handled by [middleware](/middleware) in traditional Express applications. Middleware is a fine choice for authentication, since things like token validation and attaching properties to the `request` object are not strongly connected with a particular route context (and its metadata).

But middleware, by its nature, is dumb. It doesn't know which handler will be executed after calling the `next()` function. On the other hand, **Guards** have access to the `ExecutionContext` instance, and thus know exactly what's going to be executed next. They're designed, much like exception filters, pipes, and interceptors, to let you interpose processing logic at exactly the right point in the request/response cycle, and to do so declaratively. This helps keep your code DRY and declarative.

> info **Hint** Guards are executed **after** each middleware, but **before** any interceptor or pipe.

#### Authorization guard

As mentioned, **authorization** is a great use case for Guards because specific routes should be available only when the caller (usually a specific authenticated user) has sufficient permissions. The `AuthGuard` that we'll build now assumes an authenticated user (and that, therefore, a token is attached to the request headers). It will extract and validate the token, and use the extracted information to determine whether the request can proceed or not.

```typescript
@@filename(auth.guard)
import { Injectable, CanActivate, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable()
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  canActivate(
    context: ExecutionContext,
  ): boolean | Promise<boolean> | Observable<boolean> {
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    return validateRequest(request);
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class AuthGuard {
  async canActivate(context) {
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    return validateRequest(request);
  }
}
```

The logic inside the `validateRequest()` function can be as simple or sophisticated as needed. The main point of this example is to show how guards fit into the request/response cycle.

Every guard must implement a `canActivate()` function. This function should return a boolean, indicating whether the current request is allowed or not. It can return the response either synchronously or asynchronously (via a `Promise` or `Observable`). Nest uses the return value to control the next action:

- if it returns `true`, the request will be processed.
- if it returns `false`, Nest will deny the request.

<app-banner-enterprise></app-banner-enterprise>

#### Execution context

The `canActivate()` function takes a single argument, the `ExecutionContext` instance. The `ExecutionContext` inherits from `ArgumentsHost`. We saw `ArgumentsHost` previously in the exception filters chapter. In the sample above, we are just using the same helper methods defined on `ArgumentsHost` that we used earlier, to get a reference to the `Request` object. You can refer back to the **Arguments host** section of the [exception filters](https://docs.nestjs.com/exception-filters#arguments-host) chapter for more on this topic.

By extending `ArgumentsHost`, `ExecutionContext` also adds several new helper methods that provide additional details about the current execution process. These details can be helpful in building more generic guards that can work across a broad set of controllers, methods, and execution contexts. Learn more about `ExecutionContext` [here](/fundamentals/execution-context).

#### Role-based authentication

Let's build a more functional guard that permits access only to users with a specific role. We'll start with a basic guard template, and build on it in the coming sections. For now, it allows all requests to proceed:

```typescript
@@filename(roles.guard)
import { Injectable, CanActivate, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable()
export class RolesGuard implements CanActivate {
  canActivate(
    context: ExecutionContext,
  ): boolean | Promise<boolean> | Observable<boolean> {
    return true;
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class RolesGuard {
  canActivate(context) {
    return true;
  }
}
```

#### Binding guards

Like pipes and exception filters, guards can be **controller-scoped**, method-scoped, or global-scoped. Below, we set up a controller-scoped guard using the `@UseGuards()` decorator. This decorator may take a single argument, or a comma-separated list of arguments. This lets you easily apply the appropriate set of guards with one declaration.

```typescript
@@filename()
@Controller('cats')
@UseGuards(RolesGuard)
export class CatsController {}
```

> info **Hint** The `@UseGuards()` decorator is imported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

Above, we passed the `RolesGuard` type (instead of an instance), leaving responsibility for instantiation to the framework and enabling dependency injection. As with pipes and exception filters, we can also pass an in-place instance:

```typescript
@@filename()
@Controller('cats')
@UseGuards(new RolesGuard())
export class CatsController {}
```

The construction above attaches the guard to every handler declared by this controller. If we wish the guard to apply only to a single method, we apply the `@UseGuards()` decorator at the **method level**.

In order to set up a global guard, use the `useGlobalGuards()` method of the Nest application instance:

```typescript
@@filename()
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
app.useGlobalGuards(new RolesGuard());
```

> warning **Notice** In the case of hybrid apps the `useGlobalGuards()` method doesn't set up guards for gateways and micro services by default (see [Hybrid application](/faq/hybrid-application) for information on how to change this behavior). For "standard" (non-hybrid) microservice apps, `useGlobalGuards()` does mount the guards globally.

Global guards are used across the whole application, for every controller and every route handler. In terms of dependency injection, global guards registered from outside of any module (with `useGlobalGuards()` as in the example above) cannot inject dependencies since this is done outside the context of any module. In order to solve this issue, you can set up a guard directly from any module using the following construction:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { APP_GUARD } from '@nestjs/core';

@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: APP_GUARD,
      useClass: RolesGuard,
    },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}

#### Setting roles per handler

Our `RolesGuard` is working, but it's not very smart yet. We're not yet taking advantage of the most important guard feature - the [execution context](/fundamentals/execution-context). It doesn't yet know about roles, or which roles are allowed for each handler. The `CatsController`, for example, could have different permission schemes for different routes. Some might be available only for an admin user, and others could be open for everyone. How can we match roles to routes in a flexible and reusable way?

This is where **custom metadata** comes into play (learn more [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/execution-context#reflection-and-metadata)). Nest provides the ability to attach custom **metadata** to route handlers through the `@SetMetadata()` decorator. This metadata supplies our missing `role` data, which a smart guard needs to make decisions. Let's take a look at using `@SetMetadata()`:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Post()
@SetMetadata('roles', ['admin'])
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
@@switch
@Post()
@SetMetadata('roles', ['admin'])
@Bind(Body())
async create(createCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
```

> info **Hint** The `@SetMetadata()` decorator is imported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

With the construction above, we attached the `roles` metadata (`roles` is a key, while `['admin']` is a particular value) to the `create()` method. While this works, it's not good practice to use `@SetMetadata()` directly in your routes. Instead, create your own decorators, as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename(roles.decorator)
import { SetMetadata } from '@nestjs/common';

export const Roles = (...roles: string[]) => SetMetadata('roles', roles);
@@switch
import { SetMetadata } from '@nestjs/common';

export const Roles = (...roles) => SetMetadata('roles', roles);
```

This approach is much cleaner and more readable, and is strongly typed. Now that we have a custom `@Roles()` decorator, we can use it to decorate the `create()` method.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Post()
@Roles('admin')
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
@@switch
@Post()
@Roles('admin')
@Bind(Body())
async create(createCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
```

#### Putting it all together

Let's now go back and tie this together with our `RolesGuard`. Currently, it simply returns `true` in all cases, allowing every request to proceed. We want to make the return value conditional based on the comparing the **roles assigned to the current user** to the actual roles required by the current route being processed. In order to access the route's role(s) (custom metadata), we'll use the `Reflector` helper class, which is provided out of the box by the framework and exposed from the `@nestjs/core` package.

```typescript
@@filename(roles.guard)
import { Injectable, CanActivate, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Reflector } from '@nestjs/core';

@Injectable()
export class RolesGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private reflector: Reflector) {}

  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
    const roles = this.reflector.get<string[]>('roles', context.getHandler());
    if (!roles) {
      return true;
    }
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const user = request.user;
    return matchRoles(roles, user.roles);
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable, Dependencies } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Reflector } from '@nestjs/core';

@Injectable()
@Dependencies(Reflector)
export class RolesGuard {
  constructor(reflector) {
    this.reflector = reflector;
  }

  canActivate(context) {
    const roles = this.reflector.get('roles', context.getHandler());
    if (!roles) {
      return true;
    }
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const user = request.user;
    return matchRoles(roles, user.roles);
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** In the node.js world, it's common practice to attach the authorized user to the `request` object. Thus, in our sample code above, we are assuming that `request.user` contains the user instance and allowed roles. In your app, you will probably make that association in your custom **authentication guard** (or middleware).

> warning **Warning** The logic inside the `matchRoles()` function can be as simple or sophisticated as needed. The main point of this example is to show how guards fit into the request/response cycle.

Refer to the <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/execution-context#reflection-and-metadata">Reflection and metadata</a> section of the **Execution context** chapter for more details on utilizing `Reflector` in a context-sensitive way.

When a user with insufficient privileges requests an endpoint, Nest automatically returns the following response:

```typescript
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "message": "Forbidden resource",
  "error": "Forbidden"
}
```

Note that behind the scenes, when a guard returns `false`, the framework throws a `ForbiddenException`. If you want to return a different error response, you should throw your own specific exception. For example:

```typescript
throw new UnauthorizedException();
```

Any exception thrown by a guard will be handled by the [exceptions layer](/exception-filters) (global exceptions filter and any exceptions filters that are applied to the current context).
### Interceptors <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/interceptors"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="interceptors-ov" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

An interceptor is a class annotated with the `@Injectable()` decorator. Interceptors should implement the `NestInterceptor` interface.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/Interceptors_1.png" /></figure>

Interceptors have a set of useful capabilities which are inspired by the [Aspect Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming) (AOP) technique. They make it possible to:

- bind **extra logic** before / after method execution
- **transform** the result returned from a function
- **transform** the exception thrown from a function
- **extend** the basic function behavior
- completely **override** a function depending on specific conditions (e.g., for caching purposes)

#### Basics

Each interceptor implements the `intercept()` method, which takes two arguments. The first one is the `ExecutionContext` instance (exactly the same object as for [guards](/guards)). The `ExecutionContext` inherits from `ArgumentsHost`. We saw `ArgumentsHost` before in the exception filters chapter. There, we saw that it's a wrapper around arguments that have been passed to the original handler, and contains different arguments arrays based on the type of the application. You can refer back to the [exception filters](https://docs.nestjs.com/exception-filters#arguments-host) for more on this topic.

#### Execution context

By extending `ArgumentsHost`, `ExecutionContext` also adds several new helper methods that provide additional details about the current execution process. These details can be helpful in building more generic interceptors that can work across a broad set of controllers, methods, and execution contexts. Learn more about `ExecutionContext` [here](/fundamentals/execution-context).

#### Call handler

The second argument is a `CallHandler`. The `CallHandler` interface implements the `handle()` method, which you can use to invoke the route handler method at some point in your interceptor. If you don't call the `handle()` method in your implementation of the `intercept()` method, the route handler method won't be executed at all.

This approach means that the `intercept()` method effectively **wraps** the request/response stream. As a result, you may implement custom logic **both before and after** the execution of the final route handler. It's clear that you can write code in your `intercept()` method that executes **before** calling `handle()`, but how do you affect what happens afterward? Because the `handle()` method returns an `Observable`, we can use powerful [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) operators to further manipulate the response. Using Aspect Oriented Programming terminology, the invocation of the route handler (i.e., calling `handle()`) is called a [Pointcut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointcut), indicating that it's the point at which our additional logic is inserted.

Consider, for example, an incoming `POST /cats` request. This request is destined for the `create()` handler defined inside the `CatsController`. If an interceptor which does not call the `handle()` method is called anywhere along the way, the `create()` method won't be executed. Once `handle()` is called (and its `Observable` has been returned), the `create()` handler will be triggered. And once the response stream is received via the `Observable`, additional operations can be performed on the stream, and a final result returned to the caller.

#### Aspect interception

The first use case we'll look at is to use an interceptor to log user interaction (e.g., storing user calls, asynchronously dispatching events or calculating a timestamp). We show a simple `LoggingInterceptor` below:

```typescript
@@filename(logging.interceptor)
import { Injectable, NestInterceptor, ExecutionContext, CallHandler } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { tap } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class LoggingInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    console.log('Before...');

    const now = Date.now();
    return next
      .handle()
      .pipe(
        tap(() => console.log(`After... ${Date.now() - now}ms`)),
      );
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { tap } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class LoggingInterceptor {
  intercept(context, next) {
    console.log('Before...');

    const now = Date.now();
    return next
      .handle()
      .pipe(
        tap(() => console.log(`After... ${Date.now() - now}ms`)),
      );
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** The `NestInterceptor<T, R>` is a generic interface in which `T` indicates the type of an `Observable<T>` (supporting the response stream), and `R` is the type of the value wrapped by `Observable<R>`.

> warning **Notice** Interceptors, like controllers, providers, guards, and so on, can **inject dependencies** through their `constructor`.

Since `handle()` returns an RxJS `Observable`, we have a wide choice of operators we can use to manipulate the stream. In the example above, we used the `tap()` operator, which invokes our anonymous logging function upon graceful or exceptional termination of the observable stream, but doesn't otherwise interfere with the response cycle.

#### Binding interceptors

In order to set up the interceptor, we use the `@UseInterceptors()` decorator imported from the `@nestjs/common` package. Like [pipes](/pipes) and [guards](/guards), interceptors can be controller-scoped, method-scoped, or global-scoped.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@UseInterceptors(LoggingInterceptor)
export class CatsController {}
```

> info **Hint** The `@UseInterceptors()` decorator is imported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

Using the above construction, each route handler defined in `CatsController` will use `LoggingInterceptor`. When someone calls the `GET /cats` endpoint, you'll see the following output in your standard output:

```typescript
Before...
After... 1ms
```

Note that we passed the `LoggingInterceptor` type (instead of an instance), leaving responsibility for instantiation to the framework and enabling dependency injection. As with pipes, guards, and exception filters, we can also pass an in-place instance:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@UseInterceptors(new LoggingInterceptor())
export class CatsController {}
```

As mentioned, the construction above attaches the interceptor to every handler declared by this controller. If we want to restrict the interceptor's scope to a single method, we simply apply the decorator at the **method level**.

In order to set up a global interceptor, we use the `useGlobalInterceptors()` method of the Nest application instance:

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
app.useGlobalInterceptors(new LoggingInterceptor());
```

Global interceptors are used across the whole application, for every controller and every route handler. In terms of dependency injection, global interceptors registered from outside of any module (with `useGlobalInterceptors()`, as in the example above) cannot inject dependencies since this is done outside the context of any module. In order to solve this issue, you can set up an interceptor **directly from any module** using the following construction:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { APP_INTERCEPTOR } from '@nestjs/core';

@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: APP_INTERCEPTOR,
      useClass: LoggingInterceptor,
    },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> info **Hint** When using this approach to perform dependency injection for the interceptor, note that regardless of the
> module where this construction is employed, the interceptor is, in fact, global. Where should this be done? Choose the module
> where the interceptor (`LoggingInterceptor` in the example above) is defined. Also, `useClass` is not the only way of dealing with custom provider registration. Learn more [here](/fundamentals/custom-providers).

#### Response mapping

We already know that `handle()` returns an `Observable`. The stream contains the value **returned** from the route handler, and thus we can easily mutate it using RxJS's `map()` operator.

> warning **Warning** The response mapping feature doesn't work with the library-specific response strategy (using the `@Res()` object directly is forbidden).

Let's create the `TransformInterceptor`, which will modify each response in a trivial way to demonstrate the process. It will use RxJS's `map()` operator to assign the response object to the `data` property of a newly created object, returning the new object to the client.

```typescript
@@filename(transform.interceptor)
import { Injectable, NestInterceptor, ExecutionContext, CallHandler } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

export interface Response<T> {
  data: T;
}

@Injectable()
export class TransformInterceptor<T> implements NestInterceptor<T, Response<T>> {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<Response<T>> {
    return next.handle().pipe(map(data => ({ data })));
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class TransformInterceptor {
  intercept(context, next) {
    return next.handle().pipe(map(data => ({ data })));
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** Nest interceptors work with both synchronous and asynchronous `intercept()` methods. You can simply switch the method to `async` if necessary.

With the above construction, when someone calls the `GET /cats` endpoint, the response would look like the following (assuming that route handler returns an empty array `[]`):

```json
{
  "data": []
}
```

Interceptors have great value in creating re-usable solutions to requirements that occur across an entire application.
For example, imagine we need to transform each occurrence of a `null` value to an empty string `''`. We can do it using one line of code and bind the interceptor globally so that it will automatically be used by each registered handler.

```typescript
@@filename()
import { Injectable, NestInterceptor, ExecutionContext, CallHandler } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class ExcludeNullInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    return next
      .handle()
      .pipe(map(value => value === null ? '' : value ));
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class ExcludeNullInterceptor {
  intercept(context, next) {
    return next
      .handle()
      .pipe(map(value => value === null ? '' : value ));
  }
}
```

#### Exception mapping

Another interesting use-case is to take advantage of RxJS's `catchError()` operator to override thrown exceptions:

```typescript
@@filename(errors.interceptor)
import {
  Injectable,
  NestInterceptor,
  ExecutionContext,
  BadGatewayException,
  CallHandler,
} from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable, throwError } from 'rxjs';
import { catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class ErrorsInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    return next
      .handle()
      .pipe(
        catchError(err => throwError(new BadGatewayException())),
      );
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable, BadGatewayException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { throwError } from 'rxjs';
import { catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class ErrorsInterceptor {
  intercept(context, next) {
    return next
      .handle()
      .pipe(
        catchError(err => throwError(new BadGatewayException())),
      );
  }
}
```

#### Stream overriding

There are several reasons why we may sometimes want to completely prevent calling the handler and return a different value instead. An obvious example is to implement a cache to improve response time. Let's take a look at a simple **cache interceptor** that returns its response from a cache. In a realistic example, we'd want to consider other factors like TTL, cache invalidation, cache size, etc., but that's beyond the scope of this discussion. Here we'll provide a basic example that demonstrates the main concept.

```typescript
@@filename(cache.interceptor)
import { Injectable, NestInterceptor, ExecutionContext, CallHandler } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable, of } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable()
export class CacheInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    const isCached = true;
    if (isCached) {
      return of([]);
    }
    return next.handle();
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { of } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable()
export class CacheInterceptor {
  intercept(context, next) {
    const isCached = true;
    if (isCached) {
      return of([]);
    }
    return next.handle();
  }
}
```

Our `CacheInterceptor` has a hardcoded `isCached` variable and a hardcoded response `[]` as well. The key point to note is that we return a new stream here, created by the RxJS `of()` operator, therefore the route handler **won't be called** at all. When someone calls an endpoint that makes use of `CacheInterceptor`, the response (a hardcoded, empty array) will be returned immediately. In order to create a generic solution, you can take advantage of `Reflector` and create a custom decorator. The `Reflector` is well described in the [guards](/guards) chapter.

#### More operators

The possibility of manipulating the stream using RxJS operators gives us many capabilities. Let's consider another common use case. Imagine you would like to handle **timeouts** on route requests. When your endpoint doesn't return anything after a period of time, you want to terminate with an error response. The following construction enables this:

```typescript
@@filename(timeout.interceptor)
import { Injectable, NestInterceptor, ExecutionContext, CallHandler, RequestTimeoutException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable, throwError, TimeoutError } from 'rxjs';
import { catchError, timeout } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class TimeoutInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    return next.handle().pipe(
      timeout(5000),
      catchError(err => {
        if (err instanceof TimeoutError) {
          return throwError(new RequestTimeoutException());
        }
        return throwError(err);
      }),
    );
  };
};
@@switch
import { Injectable, RequestTimeoutException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable, throwError, TimeoutError } from 'rxjs';
import { catchError, timeout } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Injectable()
export class TimeoutInterceptor {
  intercept(context, next) {
    return next.handle().pipe(
      timeout(5000),
      catchError(err => {
        if (err instanceof TimeoutError) {
          return throwError(new RequestTimeoutException());
        }
        return throwError(err);
      }),
    );
  };
};
```

After 5 seconds, request processing will be canceled. You can also add custom logic before throwing `RequestTimeoutException` (e.g. release resources).
### Custom route decorators <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/custom-decorators"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="custom-decorators" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Nest is built around a language feature called **decorators**. Decorators are a well-known concept in a lot of commonly used programming languages, but in the JavaScript world, they're still relatively new. In order to better understand how decorators work, we recommend reading [this article](https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841). Here's a simple definition:

<blockquote class="external">
  An ES2016 decorator is an expression which returns a function and can take a target, name and property descriptor as arguments.
  You apply it by prefixing the decorator with an <code>@</code> character and placing this at the very top of what
  you are trying to decorate. Decorators can be defined for either a class, a method or a property.
</blockquote>

#### Param decorators

Nest provides a set of useful **param decorators** that you can use together with the HTTP route handlers. Below is a list of the provided decorators and the plain Express (or Fastify) objects they represent

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Request(), @Req()</code></td>
      <td><code>req</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Response(), @Res()</code></td>
      <td><code>res</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Next()</code></td>
      <td><code>next</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Session()</code></td>
      <td><code>req.session</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Param(param?: string)</code></td>
      <td><code>req.params</code> / <code>req.params[param]</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Body(param?: string)</code></td>
      <td><code>req.body</code> / <code>req.body[param]</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Query(param?: string)</code></td>
      <td><code>req.query</code> / <code>req.query[param]</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Headers(param?: string)</code></td>
      <td><code>req.headers</code> / <code>req.headers[param]</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Ip()</code></td>
      <td><code>req.ip</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@HostParam()</code></td>
      <td><code>req.hosts</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Additionally, you can create your own **custom decorators**. Why is this useful?

In the node.js world, it's common practice to attach properties to the **request** object. Then you manually extract them in each route handler, using code like the following:

```typescript
const user = req.user;
```

In order to make your code more readable and transparent, you can create a `@User()` decorator and reuse it across all of your controllers.

```typescript
@@filename(user.decorator)
import { createParamDecorator, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';

export const User = createParamDecorator(
  (data: unknown, ctx: ExecutionContext) => {
    const request = ctx.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    return request.user;
  },
);
```

Then, you can simply use it wherever it fits your requirements.

```typescript
@@filename()
@Get()
async findOne(@User() user: UserEntity) {
  console.log(user);
}
@@switch
@Get()
@Bind(User())
async findOne(user) {
  console.log(user);
}
```

#### Passing data

When the behavior of your decorator depends on some conditions, you can use the `data` parameter to pass an argument to the decorator's factory function. One use case for this is a custom decorator that extracts properties from the request object by key. Let's assume, for example, that our <a href="techniques/authentication#implementing-passport-strategies">authentication layer</a> validates requests and attaches a user entity to the request object. The user entity for an authenticated request might look like:

```json
{
  "id": 101,
  "firstName": "Alan",
  "lastName": "Turing",
  "email": "alan@email.com",
  "roles": ["admin"]
}
```

Let's define a decorator that takes a property name as key, and returns the associated value if it exists (or undefined if it doesn't exist, or if the `user` object has not been created).

```typescript
@@filename(user.decorator)
import { createParamDecorator, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';

export const User = createParamDecorator(
  (data: string, ctx: ExecutionContext) => {
    const request = ctx.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const user = request.user;

    return data ? user && user[data] : user;
  },
);
@@switch
import { createParamDecorator } from '@nestjs/common';

export const User = createParamDecorator((data, ctx) => {
  const request = ctx.switchToHttp().getRequest();
  const user = request.user;

  return data ? user && user[data] : user;
});
```

Here's how you could then access a particular property via the `@User()` decorator in the controller:

```typescript
@@filename()
@Get()
async findOne(@User('firstName') firstName: string) {
  console.log(`Hello ${firstName}`);
}
@@switch
@Get()
@Bind(User('firstName'))
async findOne(firstName) {
  console.log(`Hello ${firstName}`);
}
```

You can use this same decorator with different keys to access different properties. If the `user` object is deep or complex, this can make for easier and more readable request handler implementations.

> info **Hint** For TypeScript users, note that `createParamDecorator<T>()` is a generic. This means you can explicitly enforce type safety, for example `createParamDecorator<string>((data, ctx) => ...)`. Alternatively, specify a parameter type in the factory function, for example `createParamDecorator((data: string, ctx) => ...)`. If you omit both, the type for `data` will be `any`.

#### Working with pipes

Nest treats custom param decorators in the same fashion as the built-in ones (`@Body()`, `@Param()` and `@Query()`). This means that pipes are executed for the custom annotated parameters as well (in our examples, the `user` argument). Moreover, you can apply the pipe directly to the custom decorator:

```typescript
@@filename()
@Get()
async findOne(@User(new ValidationPipe()) user: UserEntity) {
  console.log(user);
}
@@switch
@Get()
@Bind(User(new ValidationPipe()))
async findOne(user) {
  console.log(user);
}
```

#### Decorator composition

Nest provides a helper method to compose multiple decorators. For example, suppose you want to combine all decorators related to authentication into a single decorator. This could be done with the following construction:

```typescript
@@filename(auth.decorator)
import { applyDecorators } from '@nestjs/common';

export function Auth(...roles: Role[]) {
  return applyDecorators(
    SetMetadata('roles', roles),
    UseGuards(AuthGuard, RolesGuard),
    ApiBearerAuth(),
    ApiUnauthorizedResponse({ description: 'Unauthorized' }),
  );
}
@@switch
import { applyDecorators } from '@nestjs/common';

export function Auth(...roles) {
  return applyDecorators(
    SetMetadata('roles', roles),
    UseGuards(AuthGuard, RolesGuard),
    ApiBearerAuth(),
    ApiUnauthorizedResponse({ description: 'Unauthorized' }),
  );
}
```

You can then use this custom `@Auth()` decorator as follows:

```typescript
@Get('users')
@Auth('admin')
findAllUsers() {}
```

This has the effect of applying all four decorators with a single declaration.

> warning **Warning** The `@ApiHideProperty()` decorator from the `@nestjs/swagger` package is not composable and won't work properly with the `applyDecorators` function.

### Custom providers <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="custom-providers" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

In earlier chapters, we touched on various aspects of **Dependency Injection (DI)** and how it is used in Nest. One example of this is the [constructor based](https://docs.nestjs.com/providers#dependency-injection) dependency injection used to inject instances (often service providers) into classes. You won't be surprised to learn that Dependency Injection is built in to the Nest core in a fundamental way. So far, we've only explored one main pattern. As your application grows more complex, you may need to take advantage of the full features of the DI system, so let's explore them in more detail.

#### DI fundamentals

Dependency injection is an [inversion of control (IoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) technique wherein you delegate instantiation of dependencies to the IoC container (in our case, the NestJS runtime system), instead of doing it in your own code imperatively. Let's examine what's happening in this example from the [Providers chapter](https://docs.nestjs.com/providers).

First, we define a provider. The `@Injectable()` decorator marks the `CatsService` class as a provider.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.service)
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Cat } from './interfaces/cat.interface';

@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  private readonly cats: Cat[] = [];

  findAll(): Cat[] {
    return this.cats;
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  constructor() {
    this.cats = [];
  }

  findAll() {
    return this.cats;
  }
}
```

Then we request that Nest inject the provider into our controller class:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';
import { Cat } from './interfaces/cat.interface';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  constructor(private catsService: CatsService) {}

  @Get()
  async findAll(): Promise<Cat[]> {
    return this.catsService.findAll();
  }
}
@@switch
import { Controller, Get, Bind, Dependencies } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';

@Controller('cats')
@Dependencies(CatsService)
export class CatsController {
  constructor(catsService) {
    this.catsService = catsService;
  }

  @Get()
  async findAll() {
    return this.catsService.findAll();
  }
}
```

Finally, we register the provider with the Nest IoC container:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsController } from './cats/cats.controller';
import { CatsService } from './cats/cats.service';

@Module({
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [CatsService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

What exactly is happening under the covers to make this work? There are three key steps in the process:

1. In `cats.service.ts`, the `@Injectable()` decorator declares the `CatsService` class as a class that can be managed by the Nest IoC container.

2. In `cats.controller.ts`, `CatsController` declares a dependency on the `CatsService` token with constructor injection:

```typescript
  constructor(private catsService: CatsService)
```

3. In `app.module.ts`, we associate the token `CatsService` with the class `CatsService` from the `cats.service.ts` file. We'll <a href="/fundamentals/custom-providers#standard-providers">see below</a> exactly how this association (also called _registration_) occurs.

When the Nest IoC container instantiates a `CatsController`, it first looks for any dependencies\*. When it finds the `CatsService` dependency, it performs a lookup on the `CatsService` token, which returns the `CatsService` class, per the registration step (#3 above). Assuming `SINGLETON` scope (the default behavior), Nest will then either create an instance of `CatsService`, cache it, and return it, or if one is already cached, return the existing instance.

\*This explanation is a bit simplified to illustrate the point. One important area we glossed over is that the process of analyzing the code for dependencies is very sophisticated, and happens during application bootstrapping. One key feature is that dependency analysis (or "creating the dependency graph"), is **transitive**. In the above example, if the `CatsService` itself had dependencies, those too would be resolved. The dependency graph ensures that dependencies are resolved in the correct order - essentially "bottom up". This mechanism relieves the developer from having to manage such complex dependency graphs.

<app-banner-courses></app-banner-courses>

#### Standard providers

Let's take a closer look at the `@Module()` decorator. In `app.module`, we declare:

```typescript
@Module({
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [CatsService],
})
```

The `providers` property takes an array of `providers`. So far, we've supplied those providers via a list of class names. In fact, the syntax `providers: [CatsService]` is short-hand for the more complete syntax:

```typescript
providers: [
  {
    provide: CatsService,
    useClass: CatsService,
  },
];
```

Now that we see this explicit construction, we can understand the registration process. Here, we are clearly associating the token `CatsService` with the class `CatsService`. The short-hand notation is merely a convenience to simplify the most common use-case, where the token is used to request an instance of a class by the same name.

#### Custom providers

What happens when your requirements go beyond those offered by _Standard providers_? Here are a few examples:

- You want to create a custom instance instead of having Nest instantiate (or return a cached instance of) a class
- You want to re-use an existing class in a second dependency
- You want to override a class with a mock version for testing

Nest allows you to define Custom providers to handle these cases. It provides several ways to define custom providers. Let's walk through them.

#### Value providers: `useValue`

The `useValue` syntax is useful for injecting a constant value, putting an external library into the Nest container, or replacing a real implementation with a mock object. Let's say you'd like to force Nest to use a mock `CatsService` for testing purposes.

```typescript
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';

const mockCatsService = {
  /* mock implementation
  ...
  */
};

@Module({
  imports: [CatsModule],
  providers: [
    {
      provide: CatsService,
      useValue: mockCatsService,
    },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In this example, the `CatsService` token will resolve to the `mockCatsService` mock object. `useValue` requires a value - in this case a literal object that has the same interface as the `CatsService` class it is replacing. Because of TypeScript's [structural typing](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-compatibility.html), you can use any object that has a compatible interface, including a literal object or a class instance instantiated with `new`.

#### Non-class-based provider tokens

So far, we've used class names as our provider tokens (the value of the `provide` property in a provider listed in the `providers` array). This is matched by the standard pattern used with [constructor based injection](https://docs.nestjs.com/providers#dependency-injection), where the token is also a class name. (Refer back to <a href="/fundamentals/custom-providers#di-fundamentals">DI Fundamentals</a> for a refresher on tokens if this concept isn't entirely clear). Sometimes, we may want the flexibility to use strings or symbols as the DI token. For example:

```typescript
import { connection } from './connection';

@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: 'CONNECTION',
      useValue: connection,
    },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In this example, we are associating a string-valued token (`'CONNECTION'`) with a pre-existing `connection` object we've imported from an external file.

> warning **Notice** In addition to using strings as token values, you can also use JavaScript [symbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol).

We've previously seen how to inject a provider using the standard [constructor based injection](https://docs.nestjs.com/providers#dependency-injection) pattern. This pattern **requires** that the dependency be declared with a class name. The `'CONNECTION'` custom provider uses a string-valued token. Let's see how to inject such a provider. To do so, we use the `@Inject()` decorator. This decorator takes a single argument - the token.

```typescript
@@filename()
@Injectable()
export class CatsRepository {
  constructor(@Inject('CONNECTION') connection: Connection) {}
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
@Dependencies('CONNECTION')
export class CatsRepository {
  constructor(connection) {}
}
```

> info **Hint** The `@Inject()` decorator is imported from `@nestjs/common` package.

While we directly use the string `'CONNECTION'` in the above examples for illustration purposes, for clean code organization, it's best practice to define tokens in a separate file, such as `constants.ts`. Treat them much as you would symbols or enums that are defined in their own file and imported where needed.

#### Class providers: `useClass`

The `useClass` syntax allows you to dynamically determine a class that a token should resolve to. For example, suppose we have an abstract (or default) `ConfigService` class. Depending on the current environment, we want Nest to provide a different implementation of the configuration service. The following code implements such a strategy.

```typescript
const configServiceProvider = {
  provide: ConfigService,
  useClass:
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
      ? DevelopmentConfigService
      : ProductionConfigService,
};

@Module({
  providers: [configServiceProvider],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Let's look at a couple of details in this code sample. You'll notice that we define `configServiceProvider` with a literal object first, then pass it in the module decorator's `providers` property. This is just a bit of code organization, but is functionally equivalent to the examples we've used thus far in this chapter.

Also, we have used the `ConfigService` class name as our token. For any class that depends on `ConfigService`, Nest will inject an instance of the provided class (`DevelopmentConfigService` or `ProductionConfigService`) overriding any default implementation that may have been declared elsewhere (e.g., a `ConfigService` declared with an `@Injectable()` decorator).

#### Factory providers: `useFactory`

The `useFactory` syntax allows for creating providers **dynamically**. The actual provider will be supplied by the value returned from a factory function. The factory function can be as simple or complex as needed. A simple factory may not depend on any other providers. A more complex factory can itself inject other providers it needs to compute its result. For the latter case, the factory provider syntax has a pair of related mechanisms:

1. The factory function can accept (optional) arguments.
2. The (optional) `inject` property accepts an array of providers that Nest will resolve and pass as arguments to the factory function during the instantiation process. The two lists should be correlated: Nest will pass instances from the `inject` list as arguments to the factory function in the same order.

The example below demonstrates this.

```typescript
@@filename()
const connectionFactory = {
  provide: 'CONNECTION',
  useFactory: (optionsProvider: OptionsProvider) => {
    const options = optionsProvider.get();
    return new DatabaseConnection(options);
  },
  inject: [OptionsProvider],
};

@Module({
  providers: [connectionFactory],
})
export class AppModule {}
@@switch
const connectionFactory = {
  provide: 'CONNECTION',
  useFactory: (optionsProvider) => {
    const options = optionsProvider.get();
    return new DatabaseConnection(options);
  },
  inject: [OptionsProvider],
};

@Module({
  providers: [connectionFactory],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### Alias providers: `useExisting`

The `useExisting` syntax allows you to create aliases for existing providers. This creates two ways to access the same provider. In the example below, the (string-based) token `'AliasedLoggerService'` is an alias for the (class-based) token `LoggerService`. Assume we have two different dependencies, one for `'AliasedLoggerService'` and one for `LoggerService`. If both dependencies are specified with `SINGLETON` scope, they'll both resolve to the same instance.

```typescript
@Injectable()
class LoggerService {
  /* implementation details */
}

const loggerAliasProvider = {
  provide: 'AliasedLoggerService',
  useExisting: LoggerService,
};

@Module({
  providers: [LoggerService, loggerAliasProvider],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### Non-service based providers

While providers often supply services, they are not limited to that usage. A provider can supply **any** value. For example, a provider may supply an array of configuration objects based on the current environment, as shown below:

```typescript
const configFactory = {
  provide: 'CONFIG',
  useFactory: () => {
    return process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? devConfig : prodConfig;
  },
};

@Module({
  providers: [configFactory],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### Export custom provider

Like any provider, a custom provider is scoped to its declaring module. To make it visible to other modules, it must be exported. To export a custom provider, we can either use its token or the full provider object.

The following example shows exporting using the token:

```typescript
@@filename()
const connectionFactory = {
  provide: 'CONNECTION',
  useFactory: (optionsProvider: OptionsProvider) => {
    const options = optionsProvider.get();
    return new DatabaseConnection(options);
  },
  inject: [OptionsProvider],
};

@Module({
  providers: [connectionFactory],
  exports: ['CONNECTION'],
})
export class AppModule {}
@@switch
const connectionFactory = {
  provide: 'CONNECTION',
  useFactory: (optionsProvider) => {
    const options = optionsProvider.get();
    return new DatabaseConnection(options);
  },
  inject: [OptionsProvider],
};

@Module({
  providers: [connectionFactory],
  exports: ['CONNECTION'],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Alternatively, export with the full provider object:

```typescript
@@filename()
const connectionFactory = {
  provide: 'CONNECTION',
  useFactory: (optionsProvider: OptionsProvider) => {
    const options = optionsProvider.get();
    return new DatabaseConnection(options);
  },
  inject: [OptionsProvider],
};

@Module({
  providers: [connectionFactory],
  exports: [connectionFactory],
})
export class AppModule {}
@@switch
const connectionFactory = {
  provide: 'CONNECTION',
  useFactory: (optionsProvider) => {
    const options = optionsProvider.get();
    return new DatabaseConnection(options);
  },
  inject: [OptionsProvider],
};

@Module({
  providers: [connectionFactory],
  exports: [connectionFactory],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
### Asynchronous providers <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/async-providers"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="async-providers" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

At times, the application start should be delayed until one or more **asynchronous tasks** are completed. For example, you may not want to start accepting requests until the connection with the database has been established. You can achieve this using _asynchronous providers_.

The syntax for this is to use `async/await` with the `useFactory` syntax. The factory returns a `Promise`, and the factory function can `await` asynchronous tasks. Nest will await resolution of the promise before instantiating any class that depends on (injects) such a provider.

```typescript
{
  provide: 'ASYNC_CONNECTION',
  useFactory: async () => {
    const connection = await createConnection(options);
    return connection;
  },
}
```

> info **Hint** Learn more about custom provider syntax [here](/fundamentals/custom-providers).

#### Injection

Asynchronous providers are injected to other components by their tokens, like any other provider. In the example above, you would use the construct `@Inject('ASYNC_CONNECTION')`.

#### Example

[The TypeORM recipe](/recipes/sql-typeorm) has a more substantial example of an asynchronous provider.
### Dynamic modules <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/dynamic-modules"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="dynamic-modules" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

The [Modules chapter](/modules) covers the basics of Nest modules, and includes a brief introduction to [dynamic modules](https://docs.nestjs.com/modules#dynamic-modules). This chapter expands on the subject of dynamic modules. Upon completion, you should have a good grasp of what they are and how and when to use them.

#### Introduction

Most application code examples in the **Overview** section of the documentation make use of regular, or static, modules. Modules define groups of components like [providers](/providers) and [controllers](/controllers) that fit together as a modular part of an overall application. They provide an execution context, or scope, for these components. For example, providers defined in a module are visible to other members of the module without the need to export them. When a provider needs to be visible outside of a module, it is first exported from its host module, and then imported into its consuming module.

Let's walk through a familiar example.

First, we'll define a `UsersModule` to provide and export a `UsersService`. `UsersModule` is the **host** module for `UsersService`.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UsersService } from './users.service';

@Module({
  providers: [UsersService],
  exports: [UsersService],
})
export class UsersModule {}
```

Next, we'll define an `AuthModule`, which imports `UsersModule`, making `UsersModule`'s exported providers available inside `AuthModule`:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';
import { UsersModule } from '../users/users.module';

@Module({
  imports: [UsersModule],
  providers: [AuthService],
  exports: [AuthService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
```

These constructs allow us to inject `UsersService` in, for example, the `AuthService` that is hosted in `AuthModule`:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UsersService } from '../users/users.service';

@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  constructor(private usersService: UsersService) {}
  /*
    Implementation that makes use of this.usersService
  */
}
```

We'll refer to this as **static** module binding. All the information Nest needs to wire together the modules has already been declared in the host and consuming modules. Let's unpack what's happening during this process. Nest makes `UsersService` available inside `AuthModule` by:

1. Instantiating `UsersModule`, including transitively importing other modules that `UsersModule` itself consumes, and transitively resolving any dependencies (see [Custom providers](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers)).
2. Instantiating `AuthModule`, and making `UsersModule`'s exported providers available to components in `AuthModule` (just as if they had been declared in `AuthModule`).
3. Injecting an instance of `UsersService` in `AuthService`.

#### Dynamic module use case

With static module binding, there's no opportunity for the consuming module to **influence** how providers from the host module are configured. Why does this matter? Consider the case where we have a general purpose module that needs to behave differently in different use cases. This is analogous to the concept of a "plugin" in many systems, where a generic facility requires some configuration before it can be used by a consumer.

A good example with Nest is a **configuration module**. Many applications find it useful to externalize configuration details by using a configuration module. This makes it easy to dynamically change the application settings in different deployments: e.g., a development database for developers, a staging database for the staging/testing environment, etc. By delegating the management of configuration parameters to a configuration module, the application source code remains independent of configuration parameters.

The challenge is that the configuration module itself, since it's generic (similar to a "plugin"), needs to be customized by its consuming module. This is where _dynamic modules_ come into play. Using dynamic module features, we can make our configuration module **dynamic** so that the consuming module can use an API to control how the configuration module is customized at the time it is imported.

In other words, dynamic modules provide an API for importing one module into another, and customizing the properties and behavior of that module when it is imported, as opposed to using the static bindings we've seen so far.

<app-banner-shop></app-banner-shop>

#### Config module example

We'll be using the basic version of the example code from the [configuration chapter](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration#service) for this section. The completed version as of the end of this chapter is available as a working [example here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/25-dynamic-modules).

Our requirement is to make `ConfigModule` accept an `options` object to customize it. Here's the feature we want to support. The basic sample hard-codes the location of the `.env` file to be in the project root folder. Let's suppose we want to make that configurable, such that you can manage your `.env` files in any folder of your choosing. For example, imagine you want to store your various `.env` files in a folder under the project root called `config` (i.e., a sibling folder to `src`). You'd like to be able to choose different folders when using the `ConfigModule` in different projects.

Dynamic modules give us the ability to pass parameters into the module being imported so we can change its behavior. Let's see how this works. It's helpful if we start from the end-goal of how this might look from the consuming module's perspective, and then work backwards. First, let's quickly review the example of _statically_ importing the `ConfigModule` (i.e., an approach which has no ability to influence the behavior of the imported module). Pay close attention to the `imports` array in the `@Module()` decorator:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { ConfigModule } from './config/config.module';

@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Let's consider what a _dynamic module_ import, where we're passing in a configuration object, might look like. Compare the difference in the `imports` array between these two examples:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { ConfigModule } from './config/config.module';

@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule.register({ folder: './config' })],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Let's see what's happening in the dynamic example above. What are the moving parts?

1. `ConfigModule` is a normal class, so we can infer that it must have a **static method** called `register()`. We know it's static because we're calling it on the `ConfigModule` class, not on an **instance** of the class. Note: this method, which we will create soon, can have any arbitrary name, but by convention we should call it either `forRoot()` or `register()`.
2. The `register()` method is defined by us, so we can accept any input arguments we like. In this case, we're going to accept a simple `options` object with suitable properties, which is the typical case.
3. We can infer that the `register()` method must return something like a `module` since its return value appears in the familiar `imports` list, which we've seen so far includes a list of modules.

In fact, what our `register()` method will return is a `DynamicModule`. A dynamic module is nothing more than a module created at run-time, with the same exact properties as a static module, plus one additional property called `module`. Let's quickly review a sample static module declaration, paying close attention to the module options passed in to the decorator:

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [DogsService],
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [CatsService],
  exports: [CatsService]
})
```

Dynamic modules must return an object with the exact same interface, plus one additional property called `module`. The `module` property serves as the name of the module, and should be the same as the class name of the module, as shown in the example below.

> info **Hint** For a dynamic module, all properties of the module options object are optional **except** `module`.

What about the static `register()` method? We can now see that its job is to return an object that has the `DynamicModule` interface. When we call it, we are effectively providing a module to the `imports` list, similar to the way we would do so in the static case by listing a module class name. In other words, the dynamic module API simply returns a module, but rather than fix the properties in the `@Modules` decorator, we specify them programmatically.

There are still a couple of details to cover to help make the picture complete:

1. We can now state that the `@Module()` decorator's `imports` property can take not only a module class name (e.g., `imports: [UsersModule]`), but also a function **returning** a dynamic module (e.g., `imports: [ConfigModule.register(...)]`).
2. A dynamic module can itself import other modules. We won't do so in this example, but if the dynamic module depends on providers from other modules, you would import them using the optional `imports` property. Again, this is exactly analogous to the way you'd declare metadata for a static module using the `@Module()` decorator.

Armed with this understanding, we can now look at what our dynamic `ConfigModule` declaration must look like. Let's take a crack at it.

```typescript
import { DynamicModule, Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigService } from './config.service';

@Module({})
export class ConfigModule {
  static register(): DynamicModule {
    return {
      module: ConfigModule,
      providers: [ConfigService],
      exports: [ConfigService],
    };
  }
}
```

It should now be clear how the pieces tie together. Calling `ConfigModule.register(...)` returns a `DynamicModule` object with properties which are essentially the same as those that, until now, we've provided as metadata via the `@Module()` decorator.

> info **Hint** Import `DynamicModule` from `@nestjs/common`.

Our dynamic module isn't very interesting yet, however, as we haven't introduced any capability to **configure** it as we said we would like to do. Let's address that next.

#### Module configuration

The obvious solution for customizing the behavior of the `ConfigModule` is to pass it an `options` object in the static `register()` method, as we guessed above. Let's look once again at our consuming module's `imports` property:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { ConfigModule } from './config/config.module';

@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule.register({ folder: './config' })],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

That nicely handles passing an `options` object to our dynamic module. How do we then use that `options` object in the `ConfigModule`? Let's consider that for a minute. We know that our `ConfigModule` is basically a host for providing and exporting an injectable service - the `ConfigService` - for use by other providers. It's actually our `ConfigService` that needs to read the `options` object to customize its behavior. Let's assume for the moment that we know how to somehow get the `options` from the `register()` method into the `ConfigService`. With that assumption, we can make a few changes to the service to customize its behavior based on the properties from the `options` object. (**Note**: for the time being, since we _haven't_ actually determined how to pass it in, we'll just hard-code `options`. We'll fix this in a minute).

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import { EnvConfig } from './interfaces';

@Injectable()
export class ConfigService {
  private readonly envConfig: EnvConfig;

  constructor() {
    const options = { folder: './config' };

    const filePath = `${process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'}.env`;
    const envFile = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../', options.folder, filePath);
    this.envConfig = dotenv.parse(fs.readFileSync(envFile));
  }

  get(key: string): string {
    return this.envConfig[key];
  }
}
```

Now our `ConfigService` knows how to find the `.env` file in the folder we've specified in `options`.

Our remaining task is to somehow inject the `options` object from the `register()` step into our `ConfigService`. And of course, we'll use _dependency injection_ to do it. This is a key point, so make sure you understand it. Our `ConfigModule` is providing `ConfigService`. `ConfigService` in turn depends on the `options` object that is only supplied at run-time. So, at run-time, we'll need to first bind the `options` object to the Nest IoC container, and then have Nest inject it into our `ConfigService`. Remember from the **Custom providers** chapter that providers can [include any value](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers#non-service-based-providers) not just services, so we're fine using dependency injection to handle a simple `options` object.

Let's tackle binding the options object to the IoC container first. We do this in our static `register()` method. Remember that we are dynamically constructing a module, and one of the properties of a module is its list of providers. So what we need to do is define our options object as a provider. This will make it injectable into the `ConfigService`, which we'll take advantage of in the next step. In the code below, pay attention to the `providers` array:

```typescript
import { DynamicModule, Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigService } from './config.service';

@Module({})
export class ConfigModule {
  static register(options): DynamicModule {
    return {
      module: ConfigModule,
      providers: [
        {
          provide: 'CONFIG_OPTIONS',
          useValue: options,
        },
        ConfigService,
      ],
      exports: [ConfigService],
    };
  }
}
```

Now we can complete the process by injecting the `'CONFIG_OPTIONS'` provider into the `ConfigService`. Recall that when we define a provider using a non-class token we need to use the `@Inject()` decorator [as described here](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers#non-class-based-provider-tokens).

```typescript
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { EnvConfig } from './interfaces';

@Injectable()
export class ConfigService {
  private readonly envConfig: EnvConfig;

  constructor(@Inject('CONFIG_OPTIONS') private options) {
    const filePath = `${process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'}.env`;
    const envFile = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../', options.folder, filePath);
    this.envConfig = dotenv.parse(fs.readFileSync(envFile));
  }

  get(key: string): string {
    return this.envConfig[key];
  }
}
```

One final note: for simplicity we used a string-based injection token (`'CONFIG_OPTIONS'`) above, but best practice is to define it as a constant (or `Symbol`) in a separate file, and import that file. For example:

```typescript
export const CONFIG_OPTIONS = 'CONFIG_OPTIONS';
```

#### Example

A full example of the code in this chapter can be found [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/25-dynamic-modules).

### Injection scopes <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/injection-scopes"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="injection-scopes" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

For people coming from different programming language backgrounds, it might be unexpected to learn that in Nest, almost everything is shared across incoming requests. We have a connection pool to the database, singleton services with global state, etc. Remember that Node.js doesn't follow the request/response Multi-Threaded Stateless Model in which every request is processed by a separate thread. Hence, using singleton instances is fully **safe** for our applications.

However, there are edge-cases when request-based lifetime may be the desired behavior, for instance per-request caching in GraphQL applications, request tracking, and multi-tenancy. Injection scopes provide a mechanism to obtain the desired provider lifetime behavior.

#### Provider scope

A provider can have any of the following scopes:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>DEFAULT</code></td>
    <td>A single instance of the provider is shared across the entire application. The instance lifetime is tied directly to the application lifecycle. Once the application has bootstrapped, all singleton providers have been instantiated. Singleton scope is used by default.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>REQUEST</code></td>
    <td>A new instance of the provider is created exclusively for each incoming <strong>request</strong>.  The instance is garbage-collected after the request has completed processing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>TRANSIENT</code></td>
    <td>Transient providers are not shared across consumers. Each consumer that injects a transient provider will receive a new, dedicated instance.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

> info **Hint** Using singleton scope is **recommended** for most use cases. Sharing providers across consumers and across requests means that an instance can be cached and its initialization occurs only once, during application startup.

#### Usage

Specify injection scope by passing the `scope` property to the `@Injectable()` decorator options object:

```typescript
import { Injectable, Scope } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST })
export class CatsService {}
```

Similarly, for [custom providers](/fundamentals/custom-providers), set the `scope` property in the long-hand form for a provider registration:

```typescript
{
  provide: 'CACHE_MANAGER',
  useClass: CacheManager,
  scope: Scope.TRANSIENT,
}
```

> info **Hint** Import the `Scope` enum from `@nestjs/common`

> warning **Notice** Gateways should not use request-scoped providers because they must act as singletons. Each gateway encapsulates a real socket and cannot be instantiated multiple times.

Singleton scope is used by default, and need not be declared. If you do want to declare a provider as singleton scoped, use the `Scope.DEFAULT` value for the `scope` property.

#### Controller scope

Controllers can also have scope, which applies to all request method handlers declared in that controller. Like provider scope, the scope of a controller declares its lifetime. For a request-scoped controller, a new instance is created for each inbound request, and garbage-collected when the request has completed processing.

Declare controller scope with the `scope` property of the `ControllerOptions` object:

```typescript
@Controller({
  path: 'cats',
  scope: Scope.REQUEST,
})
export class CatsController {}
```

#### Scope hierarchy

Scope bubbles up the injection chain. A controller that depends on a request-scoped provider will, itself, be request-scoped.

Imagine the following dependency graph: `CatsController <- CatsService <- CatsRepository`. If `CatsService` is request-scoped (and the others are default singletons), the `CatsController` will become request-scoped as it is dependent on the injected service. The `CatsRepository`, which is not dependent, would remain singleton-scoped.

<app-banner-courses></app-banner-courses>

#### Request provider

In an HTTP server-based application (e.g., using `@nestjs/platform-express` or `@nestjs/platform-fastify`), you may want to access a reference to the original request object when using request-scoped providers. You can do this by injecting the `REQUEST` object.

```typescript
import { Injectable, Scope, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { REQUEST } from '@nestjs/core';
import { Request } from 'express';

@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST })
export class CatsService {
  constructor(@Inject(REQUEST) private request: Request) {}
}
```

Because of underlying platform/protocol differences, you access the inbound request slightly differently for Microservice or GraphQL applications. In [GraphQL](/graphql/quick-start) applications, you inject `CONTEXT` instead of `REQUEST`:

```typescript
import { Injectable, Scope, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CONTEXT } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST })
export class CatsService {
  constructor(@Inject(CONTEXT) private context) {}
}
```

You then configure your `context` value (in the `GraphQLModule`) to contain `request` as its property.

#### Performance

Using request-scoped providers will have an impact on application performance. While Nest tries to cache as much metadata as possible, it will still have to create an instance of your class on each request. Hence, it will slow down your average response time and overall benchmarking result. Unless a provider must be request-scoped, it is strongly recommended that you use the default singleton scope.
### Circular dependency <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/circular-dependency"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="circular-dependency" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

A circular dependency occurs when two classes depend on each other. For example, class A needs class B, and class B also needs class A. Circular dependencies can arise in Nest between modules and between providers.

While circular dependencies should be avoided where possible, you can't always do so. In such cases, Nest enables resolving circular dependencies between providers in two ways. In this chapter, we describe using **forward referencing** as one technique, and using the **ModuleRef** class to retrieve a provider instance from the DI container as another.

We also describe resolving circular dependencies between modules.

#### Forward reference

A **forward reference** allows Nest to reference classes which aren't yet defined using the `forwardRef()` utility function. For example, if `CatsService` and `CommonService` depend on each other, both sides of the relationship can use `@Inject()` and the `forwardRef()` utility to resolve the circular dependency. Otherwise Nest won't instantiate them because all of the essential metadata won't be available. Here's an example:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.service)
@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  constructor(
    @Inject(forwardRef(() => CommonService))
    private commonService: CommonService,
  ) {}
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
@Dependencies(forwardRef(() => CommonService))
export class CatsService {
  constructor(commonService) {
    this.commonService = commonService;
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** The `forwardRef()` function is imported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

That covers one side of the relationship. Now let's do the same with `CommonService`:

```typescript
@@filename(common.service)
@Injectable()
export class CommonService {
  constructor(
    @Inject(forwardRef(() => CatsService))
    private catsService: CatsService,
  ) {}
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
@Dependencies(forwardRef(() => CatsService))
export class CommonService {
  constructor(catsService) {
    this.catsService = catsService;
  }
}
```

> warning **Warning** The order of instantiation is indeterminate. Make sure your code does not depend on which constructor is called first.

#### ModuleRef class alternative

An alternative to using `forwardRef()` is to refactor your code and use the `ModuleRef` class to retrieve a provider on one side of the (otherwise) circular relationship. Learn more about the `ModuleRef` utility class [here](/fundamentals/module-ref).

#### Module forward reference

In order to resolve circular dependencies between modules, use the same `forwardRef()` utility function on both sides of the modules association. For example:

```typescript
@@filename(common.module)
@Module({
  imports: [forwardRef(() => CatsModule)],
})
export class CommonModule {}
```
### Module reference <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/module-ref"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="module-ref" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Nest provides the `ModuleRef` class to navigate the internal list of providers and obtain a reference to any provider using its injection token as a lookup key. The `ModuleRef` class also provides a way to dynamically instantiate both static and scoped providers. `ModuleRef` can be injected into a class in the normal way:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.service)
@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  constructor(private moduleRef: ModuleRef) {}
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
@Dependencies(ModuleRef)
export class CatsService {
  constructor(moduleRef) {
    this.moduleRef = moduleRef;
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** The `ModuleRef` class is imported from the `@nestjs/core` package.

#### Retrieving instances

The `ModuleRef` instance (hereafter we'll refer to it as the **module reference**) has a `get()` method. This method retrieves a provider, controller, or injectable (e.g., guard, interceptor, etc.) that exists (has been instantiated) in the **current** module using its injection token/class name.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.service)
@Injectable()
export class CatsService implements OnModuleInit {
  private service: Service;
  constructor(private moduleRef: ModuleRef) {}

  onModuleInit() {
    this.service = this.moduleRef.get(Service);
  }
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
@Dependencies(ModuleRef)
export class CatsService {
  constructor(moduleRef) {
    this.moduleRef = moduleRef;
  }

  onModuleInit() {
    this.service = this.moduleRef.get(Service);
  }
}
```

> warning **Warning** You can't retrieve scoped providers (transient or request-scoped) with the `get()` method. Instead, use the technique described <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/module-ref#resolving-scoped-providers">below</a>. Learn how to control scopes [here](/fundamentals/injection-scopes).

To retrieve a provider from the global context (for example, if the provider has been injected in a different module), pass the `{{ '{' }} strict: false {{ '}' }}` option as a second argument to `get()`.

```typescript
this.moduleRef.get(Service, { strict: false });
```

#### Resolving scoped providers

To dynamically resolve a scoped provider (transient or request-scoped), use the `resolve()` method, passing the provider's injection token as an argument.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.service)
@Injectable()
export class CatsService implements OnModuleInit {
  private transientService: TransientService;
  constructor(private moduleRef: ModuleRef) {}

  async onModuleInit() {
    this.transientService = await this.moduleRef.resolve(TransientService);
  }
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
@Dependencies(ModuleRef)
export class CatsService {
  constructor(moduleRef) {
    this.moduleRef = moduleRef;
  }

  async onModuleInit() {
    this.transientService = await this.moduleRef.resolve(TransientService);
  }
}
```

The `resolve()` method returns a unique instance of the provider, from its own **DI container sub-tree**. Each sub-tree has a unique **context identifier**. Thus, if you call this method more than once and compare instance references, you will see that they are not equal.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.service)
@Injectable()
export class CatsService implements OnModuleInit {
  constructor(private moduleRef: ModuleRef) {}

  async onModuleInit() {
    const transientServices = await Promise.all([
      this.moduleRef.resolve(TransientService),
      this.moduleRef.resolve(TransientService),
    ]);
    console.log(transientServices[0] === transientServices[1]); // false
  }
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
@Dependencies(ModuleRef)
export class CatsService {
  constructor(moduleRef) {
    this.moduleRef = moduleRef;
  }

  async onModuleInit() {
    const transientServices = await Promise.all([
      this.moduleRef.resolve(TransientService),
      this.moduleRef.resolve(TransientService),
    ]);
    console.log(transientServices[0] === transientServices[1]); // false
  }
}
```

To generate a single instance across multiple `resolve()` calls, and ensure they share the same generated DI container sub-tree, you can pass a context identifier to the `resolve()` method. Use the `ContextIdFactory` class to generate a context identifier. This class provides a `create()` method that returns an appropriate unique identifier.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.service)
@Injectable()
export class CatsService implements OnModuleInit {
  constructor(private moduleRef: ModuleRef) {}

  async onModuleInit() {
    const contextId = ContextIdFactory.create();
    const transientServices = await Promise.all([
      this.moduleRef.resolve(TransientService, contextId),
      this.moduleRef.resolve(TransientService, contextId),
    ]);
    console.log(transientServices[0] === transientServices[1]); // true
  }
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
@Dependencies(ModuleRef)
export class CatsService {
  constructor(moduleRef) {
    this.moduleRef = moduleRef;
  }

  async onModuleInit() {
    const contextId = ContextIdFactory.create();
    const transientServices = await Promise.all([
      this.moduleRef.resolve(TransientService, contextId),
      this.moduleRef.resolve(TransientService, contextId),
    ]);
    console.log(transientServices[0] === transientServices[1]); // true
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** The `ContextIdFactory` class is imported from the `@nestjs/core` package.

#### Getting current sub-tree

Occasionally, you may want to resolve an instance of a request-scoped provider within a **request context**. Let's say that `CatsService` is request-scoped and you want to resolve the `CatsRepository` instance which is also marked as a request-scoped provider. In order to share the same DI container sub-tree, you must obtain the current context identifier instead of generating a new one (e.g., with the `ContextIdFactory.create()` function, as shown above). To obtain the current context identifier, start by injecting the request object using `@Inject()` decorator.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.service)
@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  constructor(
    @Inject(REQUEST) private request: Record<string, unknown>,
  ) {}
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
@Dependencies(REQUEST)
export class CatsService {
  constructor(request) {
    this.request = request;
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** Learn more about the request provider [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/injection-scopes#request-provider).

Now, use the `getByRequest()` method of the `ContextIdFactory` class to create a context id based on the request object, and pass this to the `resolve()` call:

```typescript
const contextId = ContextIdFactory.getByRequest(this.request);
const catsRepository = await this.moduleRef.resolve(CatsRepository, contextId);
```

#### Instantiating custom classes dynamically

To dynamically instantiate a class that **wasn't previously registered** as a **provider**, use the module reference's `create()` method.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.service)
@Injectable()
export class CatsService implements OnModuleInit {
  private catsFactory: CatsFactory;
  constructor(private moduleRef: ModuleRef) {}

  async onModuleInit() {
    this.catsFactory = await this.moduleRef.create(CatsFactory);
  }
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
@Dependencies(ModuleRef)
export class CatsService {
  constructor(moduleRef) {
    this.moduleRef = moduleRef;
  }

  async onModuleInit() {
    this.catsFactory = await this.moduleRef.create(CatsFactory);
  }
}
```

This technique enables you to conditionally instantiate different classes outside of the framework container.

### Execution context <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/execution-context"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="execution-context" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Nest provides several utility classes that help make it easy to write applications that function across multiple application contexts (e.g., Nest HTTP server-based, microservices and WebSockets application contexts). These utilities provide information about the current execution context which can be used to build generic [guards](/guards), [filters](/exception-filters), and [interceptors](/interceptors) that can work across a broad set of controllers, methods, and execution contexts.

We cover two such classes in this chapter: `ArgumentsHost` and `ExecutionContext`.

#### ArgumentsHost class

The `ArgumentsHost` class provides methods for retrieving the arguments being passed to a handler. It allows choosing the appropriate context (e.g., HTTP, RPC (microservice), or WebSockets) to retrieve the arguments from. The framework provides an instance of `ArgumentsHost`, typically referenced as a `host` parameter, in places where you may want to access it. For example, the `catch()` method of an [exception filter](https://docs.nestjs.com/exception-filters#arguments-host) is called with an `ArgumentsHost`instance.

`ArgumentsHost` simply acts as an abstraction over a handler's arguments. For example, for HTTP server applications (when `@nestjs/platform-express` is being used), the `host` object encapsulates Express's `[request, response, next]` array, where `request` is the request object, `response` is the response object, and `next` is a function that controls the application's request-response cycle. On the other hand, for [GraphQL](/graphql/quick-start) applications, the `host` object contains the `[root, args, context, info]` array.

#### Current application context

When building generic [guards](/guards), [filters](/exception-filters), and [interceptors](/interceptors) which are meant to run across multiple application contexts, we need a way to determine the type of application that our method is currently running in. Do this with the `getType()` method of `ArgumentsHost`:

```typescript
if (host.getType() === 'http') {
  // do something that is only important in the context of regular HTTP requests (REST)
} else if (host.getType() === 'rpc') {
  // do something that is only important in the context of Microservice requests
} else if (host.getType<GqlContextType>() === 'graphql') {
  // do something that is only important in the context of GraphQL requests
}
```

> info **Hint** The `GqlContextType` is imported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package.

With the application type available, we can write more generic components, as shown below.

#### Host handler arguments

To retrieve the array of arguments being passed to the handler, one approach is to use the host object's `getArgs()` method.

```typescript
const [req, res, next] = host.getArgs();
```

You can pluck a particular argument by index using the `getArgByIndex()` method:

```typescript
const request = host.getArgByIndex(0);
const response = host.getArgByIndex(1);
```

In these examples we retrieved the request and response objects by index, which is not typically recommended as it couples the application to a particular execution context. Instead, you can make your code more robust and reusable by using one of the `host` object's utility methods to switch to the appropriate application context for your application. The context switch utility methods are shown below.

```typescript
/**
 * Switch context to RPC.
 */
switchToRpc(): RpcArgumentsHost;
/**
 * Switch context to HTTP.
 */
switchToHttp(): HttpArgumentsHost;
/**
 * Switch context to WebSockets.
 */
switchToWs(): WsArgumentsHost;
```

Let's rewrite the previous example using the `switchToHttp()` method. The `host.switchToHttp()` helper call returns an `HttpArgumentsHost` object that is appropriate for the HTTP application context. The `HttpArgumentsHost` object has two useful methods we can use to extract the desired objects. We also use the Express type assertions in this case to return native Express typed objects:

```typescript
const ctx = host.switchToHttp();
const request = ctx.getRequest<Request>();
const response = ctx.getResponse<Response>();
```

Similarly `WsArgumentsHost` and `RpcArgumentsHost` have methods to return appropriate objects in the microservices and WebSockets contexts. Here are the methods for `WsArgumentsHost`:

```typescript
export interface WsArgumentsHost {
  /**
   * Returns the data object.
   */
  getData<T>(): T;
  /**
   * Returns the client object.
   */
  getClient<T>(): T;
}
```

Following are the methods for `RpcArgumentsHost`:

```typescript
export interface RpcArgumentsHost {
  /**
   * Returns the data object.
   */
  getData<T>(): T;

  /**
   * Returns the context object.
   */
  getContext<T>(): T;
}
```

#### ExecutionContext class

`ExecutionContext` extends `ArgumentsHost`, providing additional details about the current execution process. Like `ArgumentsHost`, Nest provides an instance of `ExecutionContext` in places you may need it, such as in the `canActivate()` method of a [guard](https://docs.nestjs.com/guards#execution-context) and the `intercept()` method of an [interceptor](https://docs.nestjs.com/interceptors#execution-context). It provides the following methods:

```typescript
export interface ExecutionContext extends ArgumentsHost {
  /**
   * Returns the type of the controller class which the current handler belongs to.
   */
  getClass<T>(): Type<T>;
  /**
   * Returns a reference to the handler (method) that will be invoked next in the
   * request pipeline.
   */
  getHandler(): Function;
}
```

The `getHandler()` method returns a reference to the handler about to be invoked. The `getClass()` method returns the type of the `Controller` class which this particular handler belongs to. For example, in an HTTP context, if the currently processed request is a `POST` request, bound to the `create()` method on the `CatsController`, `getHandler()` returns a reference to the `create()` method and `getClass()` returns the `CatsController` **type** (not instance).

```typescript
const methodKey = ctx.getHandler().name; // "create"
const className = ctx.getClass().name; // "CatsController"
```

The ability to access references to both the current class and handler method provides great flexibility. Most importantly, it gives us the opportunity to access the metadata set through the `@SetMetadata()` decorator from within guards or interceptors. We cover this use case below.

<app-banner-enterprise></app-banner-enterprise>

#### Reflection and metadata

Nest provides the ability to attach **custom metadata** to route handlers through the `@SetMetadata()` decorator. We can then access this metadata from within our class to make certain decisions.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Post()
@SetMetadata('roles', ['admin'])
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
@@switch
@Post()
@SetMetadata('roles', ['admin'])
@Bind(Body())
async create(createCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
```

> info **Hint** The `@SetMetadata()` decorator is imported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

With the construction above, we attached the `roles` metadata (`roles` is a metadata key and `['admin']` is the associated value) to the `create()` method. While this works, it's not good practice to use `@SetMetadata()` directly in your routes. Instead, create your own decorators, as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename(roles.decorator)
import { SetMetadata } from '@nestjs/common';

export const Roles = (...roles: string[]) => SetMetadata('roles', roles);
@@switch
import { SetMetadata } from '@nestjs/common';

export const Roles = (...roles) => SetMetadata('roles', roles);
```

This approach is much cleaner and more readable, and is strongly typed. Now that we have a custom `@Roles()` decorator, we can use it to decorate the `create()` method.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Post()
@Roles('admin')
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
@@switch
@Post()
@Roles('admin')
@Bind(Body())
async create(createCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
```

To access the route's role(s) (custom metadata), we'll use the `Reflector` helper class, which is provided out of the box by the framework and exposed from the `@nestjs/core` package. `Reflector` can be injected into a class in the normal way:

```typescript
@@filename(roles.guard)
@Injectable()
export class RolesGuard {
  constructor(private reflector: Reflector) {}
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
@Dependencies(Reflector)
export class CatsService {
  constructor(reflector) {
    this.reflector = reflector;
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** The `Reflector` class is imported from the `@nestjs/core` package.

Now, to read the handler metadata, use the `get()` method.

```typescript
const roles = this.reflector.get<string[]>('roles', context.getHandler());
```

The `Reflector#get` method allows us to easily access the metadata by passing in two arguments: a metadata **key** and a **context** (decorator target) to retrieve the metadata from. In this example, the specified **key** is `'roles'` (refer back to the `roles.decorator.ts` file above and the `SetMetadata()` call made there). The context is provided by the call to `context.getHandler()`, which results in extracting the metadata for the currently processed route handler. Remember, `getHandler()` gives us a **reference** to the route handler function.

Alternatively, we may organize our controller by applying metadata at the controller level, applying to all routes in the controller class.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Roles('admin')
@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {}
@@switch
@Roles('admin')
@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {}
```

In this case, to extract controller metadata, we pass `context.getClass()` as the second argument (to provide the controller class as the context for metadata extraction) instead of `context.getHandler()`:

```typescript
@@filename(roles.guard)
const roles = this.reflector.get<string[]>('roles', context.getClass());
@@switch
const roles = this.reflector.get('roles', context.getClass());
```

Given the ability to provide metadata at multiple levels, you may need to extract and merge metadata from several contexts. The `Reflector` class provides two utility methods used to help with this. These methods extract **both** controller and method metadata at once, and combine them in different ways.

Consider the following scenario, where you've supplied `'roles'` metadata at both levels.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Roles('user')
@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  @Post()
  @Roles('admin')
  async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
    this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
  }
}
@@switch
@Roles('user')
@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {}
  @Post()
  @Roles('admin')
  @Bind(Body())
  async create(createCatDto) {
    this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
  }
}
```

If your intent is to specify `'user'` as the default role, and override it selectively for certain methods, you would probably use the `getAllAndOverride()` method.

```typescript
const roles = this.reflector.getAllAndOverride<string[]>('roles', [
  context.getHandler(),
  context.getClass(),
]);
```

A guard with this code, running in the context of the `create()` method, with the above metadata, would result in `roles` containing `['admin']`.

To get metadata for both and merge it (this method merges both arrays and objects), use the `getAllAndMerge()` method:

```typescript
const roles = this.reflector.getAllAndMerge<string[]>('roles', [
  context.getHandler(),
  context.getClass(),
]);
```

This would result in `roles` containing `['user', 'admin']`.

For both of these merge methods, you pass the metadata key as the first argument, and an array of metadata target contexts (i.e., calls to the `getHandler()` and/or `getClass())` methods) as the second argument.
### Lifecycle Events <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/lifecycle-events"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="lifecycle-events" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

A Nest application, as well as every application element, has a lifecycle managed by Nest. Nest provides **lifecycle hooks** that give visibility into key lifecycle events, and the ability to act (run registered code on your `module`, `injectable` or `controller`) when they occur.

#### Lifecycle sequence

The following diagram depicts the sequence of key application lifecycle events, from the time the application is bootstrapped until the node process exits. We can divide the overall lifecycle into three phases: **initializing**, **running** and **terminating**. Using this lifecycle, you can plan for appropriate initialization of modules and services, manage active connections, and gracefully shutdown your application when it receives a termination signal.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/lifecycle-events.png" /></figure>

#### Lifecycle events

Lifecycle events happen during application bootstrapping and shutdown. Nest calls registered lifecycle hook methods on `modules`, `injectables` and `controllers` at each of the following lifecycle events (**shutdown hooks** need to be enabled first, as described [below](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/lifecycle-events#application-shutdown)). As shown in the diagram above, Nest also calls the appropriate underlying methods to begin listening for connections, and to stop listening for connections.

In the following table, `onModuleDestroy`, `beforeApplicationShutdown` and `onApplicationShutdown` are only triggered if you explicitly call `app.close()` or if the process receives a special system signal (such as SIGTERM) and you have correctly called `enableShutdownHooks` at application bootstrap (see below **Application shutdown** part).

| Lifecycle hook method           | Lifecycle event triggering the hook method call                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `onModuleInit()`                | Called once the host module's dependencies have been resolved.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `onApplicationBootstrap()`      | Called once all modules have been initialized, but before listening for connections.                                                                                                                              |
| `onModuleDestroy()`\*           | Called after a termination signal (e.g., `SIGTERM`) has been received.                                                                                                                                            |
| `beforeApplicationShutdown()`\* | Called after all `onModuleDestroy()` handlers have completed (Promises resolved or rejected);<br />once complete (Promises resolved or rejected), all existing connections will be closed (`app.close()` called). |
| `onApplicationShutdown()`\*     | Called after connections close (`app.close()` resolves.                                                                                                                                                           |

\* For these events, if you're not calling `app.close()` explicitly, you must opt-in to make them work with system signals such as `SIGTERM`. See [Application shutdown](fundamentals/lifecycle-events#application-shutdown) below.

> warning **Warning** The lifecycle hooks listed above are not triggered for **request-scoped** classes. Request-scoped classes are not tied to the application lifecycle and their lifespan is unpredictable. They are exclusively created for each request and automatically garbage-collected after the response is sent.

#### Usage

Each lifecycle hook is represented by an interface. Interfaces are technically optional because they do not exist after TypeScript compilation. Nonetheless, it's good practice to use them in order to benefit from strong typing and editor tooling. To register a lifecycle hook, implement the appropriate interface. For example, to register a method to be called during module initialization on a particular class (e.g., Controller, Provider or Module), implement the `OnModuleInit` interface by supplying an `onModuleInit()` method, as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename()
import { Injectable, OnModuleInit } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class UsersService implements OnModuleInit {
  onModuleInit() {
    console.log(`The module has been initialized.`);
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  onModuleInit() {
    console.log(`The module has been initialized.`);
  }
}
```

#### Asynchronous initialization

Both the `OnModuleInit` and `OnApplicationBootstrap` hooks allow you to defer the application initialization process (return a `Promise` or mark the method as `async` and `await` an asynchronous method completion in the method body).

```typescript
@@filename()
async onModuleInit(): Promise<void> {
  await this.fetch();
}
@@switch
async onModuleInit() {
  await this.fetch();
}
```

#### Application shutdown

The `onModuleDestroy()`, `beforeApplicationShutdown()` and `onApplicationShutdown()` hooks are called in the terminating phase (in response to an explicit call to `app.close()` or upon receipt of system signals such as SIGTERM if opted-in). This feature is often used with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to manage containers' lifecycles, by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for dynos or similar services.

Shutdown hook listeners consume system resources, so they are disabled by default. To use shutdown hooks, you **must enable listeners** by calling `enableShutdownHooks()`:

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

  // Starts listening for shutdown hooks
  app.enableShutdownHooks();

  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

> warning **warning** Due to inherent platform limitations, NestJS has limited support for application shutdown hooks on Windows. You can expect `SIGINT` to work, as well as `SIGBREAK` and to some extent `SIGHUP` - [read more](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_signal_events). However `SIGTERM` will never work on Windows because killing a process in the task manager is unconditional, "i.e., there's no way for an application to detect or prevent it". Here's some [relevant documentation](https://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/signal.html) from libuv to learn more about how `SIGINT`, `SIGBREAK` and others are handled on Windows. Also, see Node.js documentation of [Process Signal Events](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_signal_events)

> info **Info** `enableShutdownHooks` consumes memory by starting listeners. In cases where you are running multiple Nest apps in a single Node process (e.g., when running parallel tests with Jest), Node may complain about excessive listener processes. For this reason, `enableShutdownHooks` is not enabled by default. Be aware of this condition when you are running multiple instances in a single Node process.

When the application receives a termination signal it will call any registered `onModuleDestroy()`, `beforeApplicationShutdown()`, then `onApplicationShutdown()` methods (in the sequence described above) with the corresponding signal as the first parameter. If a registered function awaits an asynchronous call (returns a promise), Nest will not continue in the sequence until the promise is resolved or rejected.

```typescript
@@filename()
@Injectable()
class UsersService implements OnApplicationShutdown {
  onApplicationShutdown(signal: string) {
    console.log(signal); // e.g. "SIGINT"
  }
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
class UsersService implements OnApplicationShutdown {
  onApplicationShutdown(signal) {
    console.log(signal); // e.g. "SIGINT"
  }
}
```
### Platform agnosticism <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/platform-agnosticism"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="platform-agnosticism" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Nest is a platform-agnostic framework. This means you can develop **reusable logical parts** that can be used across different types of applications. For example, most components can be re-used without change across different underlying HTTP server frameworks (e.g., Express and Fastify), and even across different _types_ of applications (e.g., HTTP server frameworks, Microservices with different transport layers, and Web Sockets).

#### Build once, use everywhere

The **Overview** section of the documentation primarily shows coding techniques using HTTP server frameworks (e.g., apps providing a REST API or providing an MVC-style server-side rendered app). However, all those building blocks can be used on top of different transport layers ([microservices](/microservices/basics) or [websockets](/websockets/gateways)).

Furthermore, Nest comes with a dedicated [GraphQL](/graphql/quick-start) module. You can use GraphQL as your API layer interchangeably with providing a REST API.

In addition, the [application context](/application-context) feature helps to create any kind of Node.js application - including things like CRON jobs and CLI apps - on top of Nest.

Nest aspires to be a full-fledged platform for Node.js apps that brings a higher-level of modularity and reusability to your applications. Build once, use everywhere!
### Testing <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/testing"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="testing" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Automated testing is considered an essential part of any serious software development effort. Automation makes it easy to repeat individual tests or test suites quickly and easily during development. This helps ensure that releases meet quality and performance goals. Automation helps increase coverage and provides a faster feedback loop to developers. Automation both increases the productivity of individual developers and ensures that tests are run at critical development lifecycle junctures, such as source code control check-in, feature integration, and version release.

Such tests often span a variety of types, including unit tests, end-to-end (e2e) tests, integration tests, and so on. While the benefits are unquestionable, it can be tedious to set them up. Nest strives to promote development best practices, including effective testing, so it includes features such as the following to help developers and teams build and automate tests. Nest:

- automatically scaffolds default unit tests for components and e2e tests for applications
- provides default tooling (such as a test runner that builds an isolated module/application loader)
- provides integration with [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) out-of-the-box, while remaining agnostic to testing tools
- makes the Nest dependency injection system available in the testing environment for easily mocking components

As mentioned, you can use any **testing framework** that you like, as Nest doesn't force any specific tooling. Simply replace the elements needed (such as the test runner), and you will still enjoy the benefits of Nest's ready-made testing facilities.

#### Installation

To get started, first install the required package:

```bash
$ npm i --save-dev @nestjs/testing
```

#### Unit testing

In the following example, we test two classes: `CatsController` and `CatsService`. As mentioned, [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) is provided as the default testing framework. It serves as a test-runner and also provides assert functions and test-double utilities that help with mocking, spying, etc. In the following basic test, we manually instantiate these classes, and ensure that the controller and service fulfill their API contract.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller.spec)
import { CatsController } from './cats.controller';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';

describe('CatsController', () => {
  let catsController: CatsController;
  let catsService: CatsService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    catsService = new CatsService();
    catsController = new CatsController(catsService);
  });

  describe('findAll', () => {
    it('should return an array of cats', async () => {
      const result = ['test'];
      jest.spyOn(catsService, 'findAll').mockImplementation(() => result);

      expect(await catsController.findAll()).toBe(result);
    });
  });
});
@@switch
import { CatsController } from './cats.controller';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';

describe('CatsController', () => {
  let catsController;
  let catsService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    catsService = new CatsService();
    catsController = new CatsController(catsService);
  });

  describe('findAll', () => {
    it('should return an array of cats', async () => {
      const result = ['test'];
      jest.spyOn(catsService, 'findAll').mockImplementation(() => result);

      expect(await catsController.findAll()).toBe(result);
    });
  });
});
```

> info **Hint** Keep your test files located near the classes they test. Testing files should have a `.spec` or `.test` suffix.

Because the above sample is trivial, we aren't really testing anything Nest-specific. Indeed, we aren't even using dependency injection (notice that we pass an instance of `CatsService` to our `catsController`). This form of testing - where we manually instantiate the classes being tested - is often called **isolated testing** as it is independent from the framework. Let's introduce some more advanced capabilities that help you test applications that make more extensive use of Nest features.

#### Testing utilities

The `@nestjs/testing` package provides a set of utilities that enable a more robust testing process. Let's rewrite the previous example using the built-in `Test` class:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller.spec)
import { Test } from '@nestjs/testing';
import { CatsController } from './cats.controller';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';

describe('CatsController', () => {
  let catsController: CatsController;
  let catsService: CatsService;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    const moduleRef = await Test.createTestingModule({
        controllers: [CatsController],
        providers: [CatsService],
      }).compile();

    catsService = moduleRef.get<CatsService>(CatsService);
    catsController = moduleRef.get<CatsController>(CatsController);
  });

  describe('findAll', () => {
    it('should return an array of cats', async () => {
      const result = ['test'];
      jest.spyOn(catsService, 'findAll').mockImplementation(() => result);

      expect(await catsController.findAll()).toBe(result);
    });
  });
});
@@switch
import { Test } from '@nestjs/testing';
import { CatsController } from './cats.controller';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';

describe('CatsController', () => {
  let catsController;
  let catsService;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    const moduleRef = await Test.createTestingModule({
        controllers: [CatsController],
        providers: [CatsService],
      }).compile();

    catsService = moduleRef.get(CatsService);
    catsController = moduleRef.get(CatsController);
  });

  describe('findAll', () => {
    it('should return an array of cats', async () => {
      const result = ['test'];
      jest.spyOn(catsService, 'findAll').mockImplementation(() => result);

      expect(await catsController.findAll()).toBe(result);
    });
  });
});
```

The `Test` class is useful for providing an application execution context that essentially mocks the full Nest runtime, but gives you hooks that make it easy to manage class instances, including mocking and overriding. The `Test` class has a `createTestingModule()` method that takes a module metadata object as its argument (the same object you pass to the `@Module()` decorator). This method returns a `TestingModule` instance which in turn provides a few methods. For unit tests, the important one is the `compile()` method. This method bootstraps a module with its dependencies (similar to the way an application is bootstrapped in the conventional `main.ts` file using `NestFactory.create()`), and returns a module that is ready for testing.

> info **Hint** The `compile()` method is **asynchronous** and therefore has to be awaited. Once the module is compiled you can retrieve any **static** instance it declares (controllers and providers) using the `get()` method.

`TestingModule` inherits from the [module reference](/fundamentals/module-ref) class, and therefore its ability to dynamically resolve scoped providers (transient or request-scoped). Do this with the `resolve()` method (the `get()` method can only retrieve static instances).

```typescript
const moduleRef = await Test.createTestingModule({
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [CatsService],
}).compile();

catsService = await moduleRef.resolve(CatsService);
```

> warning **Warning** The `resolve()` method returns a unique instance of the provider, from its own **DI container sub-tree**. Each sub-tree has a unique context identifier. Thus, if you call this method more than once and compare instance references, you will see that they are not equal.

> info **Hint** Learn more about the module reference features [here](/fundamentals/module-ref).

Instead of using the production version of any provider, you can override it with a [custom provider](/fundamentals/custom-providers) for testing purposes. For example, you can mock a database service instead of connecting to a live database. We'll cover overrides in the next section, but they're available for unit tests as well.

#### End-to-end testing

Unlike unit testing, which focuses on individual modules and classes, end-to-end (e2e) testing covers the interaction of classes and modules at a more aggregate level -- closer to the kind of interaction that end-users will have with the production system. As an application grows, it becomes hard to manually test the end-to-end behavior of each API endpoint. Automated end-to-end tests help us ensure that the overall behavior of the system is correct and meets project requirements. To perform e2e tests we use a similar configuration to the one we just covered in **unit testing**. In addition, Nest makes it easy to use the [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) library to simulate HTTP requests.

```typescript
@@filename(cats.e2e-spec)
import * as request from 'supertest';
import { Test } from '@nestjs/testing';
import { CatsModule } from '../../src/cats/cats.module';
import { CatsService } from '../../src/cats/cats.service';
import { INestApplication } from '@nestjs/common';

describe('Cats', () => {
  let app: INestApplication;
  let catsService = { findAll: () => ['test'] };

  beforeAll(async () => {
    const moduleRef = await Test.createTestingModule({
      imports: [CatsModule],
    })
      .overrideProvider(CatsService)
      .useValue(catsService)
      .compile();

    app = moduleRef.createNestApplication();
    await app.init();
  });

  it(`/GET cats`, () => {
    return request(app.getHttpServer())
      .get('/cats')
      .expect(200)
      .expect({
        data: catsService.findAll(),
      });
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    await app.close();
  });
});
@@switch
import * as request from 'supertest';
import { Test } from '@nestjs/testing';
import { CatsModule } from '../../src/cats/cats.module';
import { CatsService } from '../../src/cats/cats.service';
import { INestApplication } from '@nestjs/common';

describe('Cats', () => {
  let app: INestApplication;
  let catsService = { findAll: () => ['test'] };

  beforeAll(async () => {
    const moduleRef = await Test.createTestingModule({
      imports: [CatsModule],
    })
      .overrideProvider(CatsService)
      .useValue(catsService)
      .compile();

    app = moduleRef.createNestApplication();
    await app.init();
  });

  it(`/GET cats`, () => {
    return request(app.getHttpServer())
      .get('/cats')
      .expect(200)
      .expect({
        data: catsService.findAll(),
      });
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    await app.close();
  });
});
```

In this example, we build on some of the concepts described earlier. In addition to the `compile()` method we used earlier, we now use the `createNestApplication()` method to instantiate a full Nest runtime environment. We save a reference to the running app in our `app` variable so we can use it to simulate HTTP requests.

We simulate HTTP tests using the `request()` function from Supertest. We want these HTTP requests to route to our running Nest app, so we pass the `request()` function a reference to the HTTP listener that underlies Nest (which, in turn, may be provided by the Express platform). Hence the construction `request(app.getHttpServer())`. The call to `request()` hands us a wrapped HTTP Server, now connected to the Nest app, which exposes methods to simulate an actual HTTP request. For example, using `request(...).get('/cats')` will initiate a request to the Nest app that is identical to an **actual** HTTP request like `get '/cats'` coming in over the network.

In this example, we also provide an alternate (test-double) implementation of the `CatsService` which simply returns a hard-coded value that we can test for. Use `overrideProvider()` to provide such an alternate implementation. Similarly, Nest provides methods to override guards, interceptors, filters and pipes with the`overrideGuard()`, `overrideInterceptor()`, `overrideFilter()`, and `overridePipe()` methods respectively.

Each of the override methods returns an object with 3 different methods that mirror those described for [custom providers](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers):

- `useClass`: you supply a class that will be instantiated to provide the instance to override the object (provider, guard, etc.).
- `useValue`: you supply an instance that will override the object.
- `useFactory`: you supply a function that returns an instance that will override the object.

Each of the override method types, in turn, returns the `TestingModule` instance, and can thus be chained with other methods in the [fluent style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface). You should use `compile()` at the end of such a chain to cause Nest to instantiate and initialize the module.

The compiled module has several useful methods, as described in the following table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>createNestApplication()</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      Creates and returns a Nest application (<code>INestApplication</code> instance) based on the given module.
      Note that you must manually initialize the application using the <code>init()</code> method.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>createNestMicroservice()</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      Creates and returns a Nest microservice (<code>INestMicroservice</code> instance) based on the given module.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>get()</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      Retrieves a static instance of a controller or provider (including guards, filters, etc.) available in the application context. Inherited from the <a href="/fundamentals/module-ref">module reference</a> class.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td>
      <code>resolve()</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      Retrieves a dynamically created scoped instance (request or transient) of a controller or provider (including guards, filters, etc.) available in the application context. Inherited from the <a href="/fundamentals/module-ref">module reference</a> class.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>select()</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      Navigates through the module's dependency graph; can be used to retrieve a specific instance from the selected module (used along with strict mode (<code>strict: true</code>) in <code>get()</code> method).
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

> info **Hint** Keep your e2e test files inside the `e2e` directory. The testing files should have a `.e2e-spec` or `.e2e-test` suffix.

#### Testing request-scoped instances

[Request-scoped](/fundamentals/injection-scopes) providers are created uniquely for each incoming **request**. The instance is garbage-collected after the request has completed processing. This poses a problem, because we can't access a dependency injection sub-tree generated specifically for a tested request.

We know (based on the sections above) that the `resolve()` method can be used to retrieve a dynamically instantiated class. Also, as described <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/module-ref#resolving-scoped-providers">here</a>, we know we can pass a unique context identifier to control the lifecycle of a DI container sub-tree. How do we leverage this in a testing context?

The strategy is to generate a context identifier beforehand and force Nest to use this particular ID to create a sub-tree for all incoming requests. In this way we'll be able to retrieve instances created for a tested request.

To accomplish this, use `jest.spyOn()` on the `ContextIdFactory`:

```typescript
const contextId = ContextIdFactory.create();
jest
  .spyOn(ContextIdFactory, 'getByRequest')
  .mockImplementation(() => contextId);
```

Now we can use the `contextId` to access a single generated DI container sub-tree for any subsequent request.

```typescript
catsService = await moduleRef.resolve(CatsService, contextId);
```

### Authentication <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/authentication"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="authentication" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Authentication is an **essential** part of most applications. There are many different approaches and strategies to handle authentication. The approach taken for any project depends on its particular application requirements. This chapter presents several approaches to authentication that can be adapted to a variety of different requirements.

[Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) is the most popular node.js authentication library, well-known by the community and successfully used in many production applications. It's straightforward to integrate this library with a **Nest** application using the `@nestjs/passport` module. At a high level, Passport executes a series of steps to:

- Authenticate a user by verifying their "credentials" (such as username/password, JSON Web Token ([JWT](https://jwt.io/)), or identity token from an Identity Provider)
- Manage authenticated state (by issuing a portable token, such as a JWT, or creating an [Express session](https://github.com/expressjs/session))
- Attach information about the authenticated user to the `Request` object for further use in route handlers

Passport has a rich ecosystem of [strategies](http://www.passportjs.org/packages/) that implement various authentication mechanisms. While simple in concept, the set of Passport strategies you can choose from is large and presents a lot of variety. Passport abstracts these varied steps into a standard pattern, and the `@nestjs/passport` module wraps and standardizes this pattern into familiar Nest constructs.

In this chapter, we'll implement a complete end-to-end authentication solution for a RESTful API server using these powerful and flexible modules. You can use the concepts described here to implement any Passport strategy to customize your authentication scheme. You can follow the steps in this chapter to build this complete example. You can find a repository with a completed sample app [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/19-auth-jwt).

#### Authentication requirements

Let's flesh out our requirements. For this use case, clients will start by authenticating with a username and password. Once authenticated, the server will issue a JWT that can be sent as a [bearer token in an authorization header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) on subsequent requests to prove authentication. We'll also create a protected route that is accessible only to requests that contain a valid JWT.

We'll start with the first requirement: authenticating a user. We'll then extend that by issuing a JWT. Finally, we'll create a protected route that checks for a valid JWT on the request.

First we need to install the required packages. Passport provides a strategy called [passport-local](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-local) that implements a username/password authentication mechanism, which suits our needs for this portion of our use case.

```bash
$ npm install --save @nestjs/passport passport passport-local
$ npm install --save-dev @types/passport-local
```

> warning **Notice** For **any** Passport strategy you choose, you'll always need the `@nestjs/passport` and `passport` packages. Then, you'll need to install the strategy-specific package (e.g., `passport-jwt` or `passport-local`) that implements the particular authentication strategy you are building. In addition, you can also install the type definitions for any Passport strategy, as shown above with `@types/passport-local`, which provides assistance while writing TypeScript code.

#### Implementing Passport strategies

We're now ready to implement the authentication feature. We'll start with an overview of the process used for **any** Passport strategy. It's helpful to think of Passport as a mini framework in itself. The elegance of the framework is that it abstracts the authentication process into a few basic steps that you customize based on the strategy you're implementing. It's like a framework because you configure it by supplying customization parameters (as plain JSON objects) and custom code in the form of callback functions, which Passport calls at the appropriate time. The `@nestjs/passport` module wraps this framework in a Nest style package, making it easy to integrate into a Nest application. We'll use `@nestjs/passport` below, but first let's consider how **vanilla Passport** works.

In vanilla Passport, you configure a strategy by providing two things:

1. A set of options that are specific to that strategy. For example, in a JWT strategy, you might provide a secret to sign tokens.
2. A "verify callback", which is where you tell Passport how to interact with your user store (where you manage user accounts). Here, you verify whether a user exists (and/or create a new user), and whether their credentials are valid. The Passport library expects this callback to return a full user if the validation succeeds, or a null if it fails (failure is defined as either the user is not found, or, in the case of passport-local, the password does not match).

With `@nestjs/passport`, you configure a Passport strategy by extending the `PassportStrategy` class. You pass the strategy options (item 1 above) by calling the `super()` method in your subclass, optionally passing in an options object. You provide the verify callback (item 2 above) by implementing a `validate()` method in your subclass.

We'll start by generating an `AuthModule` and in it, an `AuthService`:

```bash
$ nest g module auth
$ nest g service auth
```

As we implement the `AuthService`, we'll find it useful to encapsulate user operations in a `UsersService`, so let's generate that module and service now:

```bash
$ nest g module users
$ nest g service users
```

Replace the default contents of these generated files as shown below. For our sample app, the `UsersService` simply maintains a hard-coded in-memory list of users, and a find method to retrieve one by username. In a real app, this is where you'd build your user model and persistence layer, using your library of choice (e.g., TypeORM, Sequelize, Mongoose, etc.).

```typescript
@@filename(users/users.service)
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

export type User = any;

@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  private readonly users: User[];

  constructor() {
    this.users = [
      {
        userId: 1,
        username: 'john',
        password: 'changeme',
      },
      {
        userId: 2,
        username: 'chris',
        password: 'secret',
      },
      {
        userId: 3,
        username: 'maria',
        password: 'guess',
      },
    ];
  }

  async findOne(username: string): Promise<User | undefined> {
    return this.users.find(user => user.username === username);
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  constructor() {
    this.users = [
      {
        userId: 1,
        username: 'john',
        password: 'changeme',
      },
      {
        userId: 2,
        username: 'chris',
        password: 'secret',
      },
      {
        userId: 3,
        username: 'maria',
        password: 'guess',
      },
    ];
  }

  async findOne(username) {
    return this.users.find(user => user.username === username);
  }
}
```

In the `UsersModule`, the only change needed is to add the `UsersService` to the exports array of the `@Module` decorator so that it is visible outside this module (we'll soon use it in our `AuthService`).

```typescript
@@filename(users/users.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UsersService } from './users.service';

@Module({
  providers: [UsersService],
  exports: [UsersService],
})
export class UsersModule {}
@@switch
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UsersService } from './users.service';

@Module({
  providers: [UsersService],
  exports: [UsersService],
})
export class UsersModule {}
```

Our `AuthService` has the job of retrieving a user and verifying the password. We create a `validateUser()` method for this purpose. In the code below, we use a convenient ES6 spread operator to strip the password property from the user object before returning it. We'll be calling into the `validateUser()` method from our Passport local strategy in a moment.

```typescript
@@filename(auth/auth.service)
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UsersService } from '../users/users.service';

@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  constructor(private usersService: UsersService) {}

  async validateUser(username: string, pass: string): Promise<any> {
    const user = await this.usersService.findOne(username);
    if (user && user.password === pass) {
      const { password, ...result } = user;
      return result;
    }
    return null;
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable, Dependencies } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UsersService } from '../users/users.service';

@Injectable()
@Dependencies(UsersService)
export class AuthService {
  constructor(usersService) {
    this.usersService = usersService;
  }

  async validateUser(username, pass) {
    const user = await this.usersService.findOne(username);
    if (user && user.password === pass) {
      const { password, ...result } = user;
      return result;
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

> Warning **Warning** Of course in a real application, you wouldn't store a password in plain text. You'd instead use a library like [bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js#readme), with a salted one-way hash algorithm. With that approach, you'd only store hashed passwords, and then compare the stored password to a hashed version of the **incoming** password, thus never storing or exposing user passwords in plain text. To keep our sample app simple, we violate that absolute mandate and use plain text. **Don't do this in your real app!**

Now, we update our `AuthModule` to import the `UsersModule`.

```typescript
@@filename(auth/auth.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';
import { UsersModule } from '../users/users.module';

@Module({
  imports: [UsersModule],
  providers: [AuthService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
@@switch
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';
import { UsersModule } from '../users/users.module';

@Module({
  imports: [UsersModule],
  providers: [AuthService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
```

#### Implementing Passport local

Now we can implement our Passport **local authentication strategy**. Create a file called `local.strategy.ts` in the `auth` folder, and add the following code:

```typescript
@@filename(auth/local.strategy)
import { Strategy } from 'passport-local';
import { PassportStrategy } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { Injectable, UnauthorizedException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Injectable()
export class LocalStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService) {
    super();
  }

  async validate(username: string, password: string): Promise<any> {
    const user = await this.authService.validateUser(username, password);
    if (!user) {
      throw new UnauthorizedException();
    }
    return user;
  }
}
@@switch
import { Strategy } from 'passport-local';
import { PassportStrategy } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { Injectable, UnauthorizedException, Dependencies } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Injectable()
@Dependencies(AuthService)
export class LocalStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  constructor(authService) {
    super();
    this.authService = authService;
  }

  async validate(username, password) {
    const user = await this.authService.validateUser(username, password);
    if (!user) {
      throw new UnauthorizedException();
    }
    return user;
  }
}
```

We've followed the recipe described earlier for all Passport strategies. In our use case with passport-local, there are no configuration options, so our constructor simply calls `super()`, without an options object.

> info **Hint** We can pass an options object in the call to `super()` to customize the behavior of the passport strategy. In this example, the passport-local strategy by default expects properties called `username` and `password` in the request body.  Pass an options object to specify different property names, for example: `super({{ '{' }} usernameField: 'email' {{ '}' }})`.  See the [Passport documentation](http://www.passportjs.org/docs/configure/) for more information.

We've also implemented the `validate()` method. For each strategy, Passport will call the verify function (implemented with the `validate()` method in `@nestjs/passport`) using an appropriate strategy-specific set of parameters. For the local-strategy, Passport expects a `validate()` method with the following signature: `validate(username: string, password:string): any`.

Most of the validation work is done in our `AuthService` (with the help of our `UsersService`), so this method is quite straightforward. The `validate()` method for **any** Passport strategy will follow a similar pattern, varying only in the details of how credentials are represented. If a user is found and the credentials are valid, the user is returned so Passport can complete its tasks (e.g., creating the `user` property on the `Request` object), and the request handling pipeline can continue. If it's not found, we throw an exception and let our <a href="exception-filters">exceptions layer</a> handle it.

Typically, the only significant difference in the `validate()` method for each strategy is **how** you determine if a user exists and is valid. For example, in a JWT strategy, depending on requirements, we may evaluate whether the `userId` carried in the decoded token matches a record in our user database, or matches a list of revoked tokens. Hence, this pattern of sub-classing and implementing strategy-specific validation is consistent, elegant and extensible.

We need to configure our `AuthModule` to use the Passport features we just defined. Update `auth.module.ts` to look like this:

```typescript
@@filename(auth/auth.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';
import { UsersModule } from '../users/users.module';
import { PassportModule } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { LocalStrategy } from './local.strategy';

@Module({
  imports: [UsersModule, PassportModule],
  providers: [AuthService, LocalStrategy],
})
export class AuthModule {}
@@switch
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';
import { UsersModule } from '../users/users.module';
import { PassportModule } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { LocalStrategy } from './local.strategy';

@Module({
  imports: [UsersModule, PassportModule],
  providers: [AuthService, LocalStrategy],
})
export class AuthModule {}
```

#### Built-in Passport Guards

The <a href="guards">Guards</a> chapter describes the primary function of Guards: to determine whether a request will be handled by the route handler or not. That remains true, and we'll use that standard capability soon. However, in the context of using the `@nestjs/passport` module, we will also introduce a slight new wrinkle that may at first be confusing, so let's discuss that now. Consider that your app can exist in two states, from an authentication perspective:

1. the user/client is **not** logged in (is not authenticated)
2. the user/client **is** logged in (is authenticated)

In the first case (user is not logged in), we need to perform two distinct functions:

- Restrict the routes an unauthenticated user can access (i.e., deny access to restricted routes). We'll use Guards in their familiar capacity to handle this function, by placing a Guard on the protected routes. As you may anticipate, we'll be checking for the presence of a valid JWT in this Guard, so we'll work on this Guard later, once we are successfully issuing JWTs.

- Initiate the **authentication step** itself when a previously unauthenticated user attempts to login. This is the step where we'll **issue** a JWT to a valid user. Thinking about this for a moment, we know we'll need to `POST` username/password credentials to initiate authentication, so we'll set up a `POST /auth/login` route to handle that. This raises the question: how exactly do we invoke the passport-local strategy in that route?

The answer is straightforward: by using another, slightly different type of Guard. The `@nestjs/passport` module provides us with a built-in Guard that does this for us. This Guard invokes the Passport strategy and kicks off the steps described above (retrieving credentials, running the verify function, creating the `user` property, etc).

The second case enumerated above (logged in user) simply relies on the standard type of Guard we already discussed to enable access to protected routes for logged in users.

<app-banner-courses></app-banner-courses>

#### Login route

With the strategy in place, we can now implement a bare-bones `/auth/login` route, and apply the built-in Guard to initiate the passport-local flow.

Open the `app.controller.ts` file and replace its contents with the following:

```typescript
@@filename(app.controller)
import { Controller, Request, Post, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard('local'))
  @Post('auth/login')
  async login(@Request() req) {
    return req.user;
  }
}
@@switch
import { Controller, Bind, Request, Post, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard('local'))
  @Post('auth/login')
  @Bind(Request())
  async login(req) {
    return req.user;
  }
}
```

With `@UseGuards(AuthGuard('local'))` we are using an `AuthGuard` that `@nestjs/passport` **automatically provisioned** for us when we extended the passport-local strategy. Let's break that down. Our Passport local strategy has a default name of `'local'`. We reference that name in the `@UseGuards()` decorator to associate it with code supplied by the `passport-local` package. This is used to disambiguate which strategy to invoke in case we have multiple Passport strategies in our app (each of which may provision a strategy-specific `AuthGuard`). While we only have one such strategy so far, we'll shortly add a second, so this is needed for disambiguation.

In order to test our route we'll have our `/auth/login` route simply return the user for now. This also lets us demonstrate another Passport feature: Passport automatically creates a `user` object, based on the value we return from the `validate()` method, and assigns it to the `Request` object as `req.user`. Later, we'll replace this with code to create and return a JWT instead.

Since these are API routes, we'll test them using the commonly available [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) library. You can test with any of the `user` objects hard-coded in the `UsersService`.

```bash
$ # POST to /auth/login
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login -d '{"username": "john", "password": "changeme"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
$ # result -> {"userId":1,"username":"john"}
```

While this works, passing the strategy name directly to the `AuthGuard()` introduces magic strings in the codebase. Instead, we recommend creating your own class, as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename(auth/local-auth.guard)
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';

@Injectable()
export class LocalAuthGuard extends AuthGuard('local') {}
```

Now, we can update the `/auth/login` route handler and use the `LocalAuthGuard` instead:

```typescript
@UseGuards(LocalAuthGuard)
@Post('auth/login')
async login(@Request() req) {
  return req.user;
}
```

#### JWT functionality

We're ready to move on to the JWT portion of our auth system. Let's review and refine our requirements:

- Allow users to authenticate with username/password, returning a JWT for use in subsequent calls to protected API endpoints. We're well on our way to meeting this requirement. To complete it, we'll need to write the code that issues a JWT.
- Create API routes which are protected based on the presence of a valid JWT as a bearer token

We'll need to install a couple more packages to support our JWT requirements:

```bash
$ npm install --save @nestjs/jwt passport-jwt
$ npm install --save-dev @types/passport-jwt
```

The `@nestjs/jwt` package (see more [here](https://github.com/nestjs/jwt)) is a utility package that helps with JWT manipulation. The `passport-jwt` package is the Passport package that implements the JWT strategy and `@types/passport-jwt` provides the TypeScript type definitions.

Let's take a closer look at how a `POST /auth/login` request is handled. We've decorated the route using the built-in `AuthGuard` provided by the passport-local strategy. This means that:

1. The route handler **will only be invoked if the user has been validated**
2. The `req` parameter will contain a `user` property (populated by Passport during the passport-local authentication flow)

With this in mind, we can now finally generate a real JWT, and return it in this route. To keep our services cleanly modularized, we'll handle generating the JWT in the `authService`. Open the `auth.service.ts` file in the `auth` folder, and add the `login()` method, and import the `JwtService` as shown:

```typescript
@@filename(auth/auth.service)
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UsersService } from '../users/users.service';
import { JwtService } from '@nestjs/jwt';

@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  constructor(
    private usersService: UsersService,
    private jwtService: JwtService
  ) {}

  async validateUser(username: string, pass: string): Promise<any> {
    const user = await this.usersService.findOne(username);
    if (user && user.password === pass) {
      const { password, ...result } = user;
      return result;
    }
    return null;
  }

  async login(user: any) {
    const payload = { username: user.username, sub: user.userId };
    return {
      access_token: this.jwtService.sign(payload),
    };
  }
}

@@switch
import { Injectable, Dependencies } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UsersService } from '../users/users.service';
import { JwtService } from '@nestjs/jwt';

@Dependencies(UsersService, JwtService)
@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  constructor(usersService, jwtService) {
    this.usersService = usersService;
    this.jwtService = jwtService;
  }

  async validateUser(username, pass) {
    const user = await this.usersService.findOne(username);
    if (user && user.password === pass) {
      const { password, ...result } = user;
      return result;
    }
    return null;
  }

  async login(user) {
    const payload = { username: user.username, sub: user.userId };
    return {
      access_token: this.jwtService.sign(payload),
    };
  }
}
```

We're using the `@nestjs/jwt` library, which supplies a `sign()` function to generate our JWT from a subset of the `user` object properties, which we then return as a simple object with a single `access_token` property. Note: we choose a property name of `sub` to hold our `userId` value to be consistent with JWT standards. Don't forget to inject the JwtService provider into the `AuthService`.

We now need to update the `AuthModule` to import the new dependencies and configure the `JwtModule`.

First, create `constants.ts` in the `auth` folder, and add the following code:

```typescript
@@filename(auth/constants)
export const jwtConstants = {
  secret: 'secretKey',
};
@@switch
export const jwtConstants = {
  secret: 'secretKey',
};
```

We'll use this to share our key between the JWT signing and verifying steps.

> Warning **Warning** **Do not expose this key publicly**. We have done so here to make it clear what the code is doing, but in a production system **you must protect this key** using appropriate measures such as a secrets vault, environment variable, or configuration service.

Now, open `auth.module.ts` in the `auth` folder and update it to look like this:

```typescript
@@filename(auth/auth.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';
import { LocalStrategy } from './local.strategy';
import { UsersModule } from '../users/users.module';

import { JwtModule } from '@nestjs/jwt';
import { jwtConstants } from './constants';

@Module({
  imports: [
    UsersModule,
    PassportModule,
    JwtModule.register({
      secret: jwtConstants.secret,
      signOptions: { expiresIn: '60s' },
    }),
  ],
  providers: [AuthService, LocalStrategy],
  exports: [AuthService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
@@switch
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';

import { jwtConstants } from './constants';

@Module({
  imports: [
    UsersModule,
    PassportModule,

      signOptions: { expiresIn: '60s' },
    }),
  ],
  providers: [AuthService, LocalStrategy],
  exports: [AuthService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
```

We configure the `JwtModule` using `register()`, passing in a configuration object. See [here](https://github.com/nestjs/jwt/blob/master/README.md) for more on the Nest `JwtModule` and [here](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#usage) for more details on the available configuration options.

Now we can update the `/auth/login` route to return a JWT.

```typescript
@@filename(app.controller)
import { Controller, Request, Post, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';
import { LocalAuthGuard } from './auth/local-auth.guard';
import { AuthService } from './auth/auth.service';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService) {}

  @UseGuards(LocalAuthGuard)
  @Post('auth/login')
  async login(@Request() req) {
    return this.authService.login(req.user);
  }
}
@@switch
import { Controller, Bind, Request, Post, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';

  constructor(private authService: AuthService) {}

  @UseGuards(LocalAuthGuard)
  @Post('auth/login')
  @Bind(Request())
  async login(req) {
    return this.authService.login(req.user);
  }
}
```

Let's go ahead and test our routes using cURL again. You can test with any of the `user` objects hard-coded in the `UsersService`.

```bash
$ # POST to /auth/login
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login -d '{"username": "john", "password": "changeme"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
$ # result -> {"access_token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."}
$ # Note: above JWT truncated
```

#### Implementing Passport JWT

We can now address our final requirement: protecting endpoints by requiring a valid JWT be present on the request. Passport can help us here too. It provides the [passport-jwt](https://github.com/mikenicholson/passport-jwt) strategy for securing RESTful endpoints with JSON Web Tokens. Start by creating a file called `jwt.strategy.ts` in the `auth` folder, and add the following code:

```typescript
@@filename(auth/jwt.strategy)
import { ExtractJwt, Strategy } from 'passport-jwt';
import { PassportStrategy } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { jwtConstants } from './constants';

@Injectable()
export class JwtStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  constructor() {
    super({
      jwtFromRequest: ExtractJwt.fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken(),
      ignoreExpiration: false,
      secretOrKey: jwtConstants.secret,
    });
  }

  async validate(payload: any) {
    return { userId: payload.sub, username: payload.username };
  }
}
@@switch
import { ExtractJwt, Strategy } from 'passport-jwt';
import { PassportStrategy } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { jwtConstants } from './constants';

@Injectable()
export class JwtStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  constructor() {
    super({
      jwtFromRequest: ExtractJwt.fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken(),
      ignoreExpiration: false,
      secretOrKey: jwtConstants.secret,
    });
  }

  async validate(payload) {
    return { userId: payload.sub, username: payload.username };
  }
}
```

With our `JwtStrategy`, we've followed the same recipe described earlier for all Passport strategies. This strategy requires some initialization, so we do that by passing in an options object in the `super()` call. You can read more about the available options [here](https://github.com/mikenicholson/passport-jwt#configure-strategy). In our case, these options are:

- `jwtFromRequest`: supplies the method by which the JWT will be extracted from the `Request`. We will use the standard approach of supplying a bearer token in the Authorization header of our API requests. Other options are described [here](https://github.com/mikenicholson/passport-jwt#extracting-the-jwt-from-the-request).
- `ignoreExpiration`: just to be explicit, we choose the default `false` setting, which delegates the responsibility of ensuring that a JWT has not expired to the Passport module. This means that if our route is supplied with an expired JWT, the request will be denied and a `401 Unauthorized` response sent. Passport conveniently handles this automatically for us.
- `secretOrKey`: we are using the expedient option of supplying a symmetric secret for signing the token. Other options, such as a PEM-encoded public key, may be more appropriate for production apps (see [here](https://github.com/mikenicholson/passport-jwt#extracting-the-jwt-from-the-request) for more information). In any case, as cautioned earlier, **do not expose this secret publicly**.

The `validate()` method deserves some discussion. For the jwt-strategy, Passport first verifies the JWT's signature and decodes the JSON. It then invokes our `validate()` method passing the decoded JSON as its single parameter. Based on the way JWT signing works, **we're guaranteed that we're receiving a valid token** that we have previously signed and issued to a valid user.

As a result of all this, our response to the `validate()` callback is trivial: we simply return an object containing the `userId` and `username` properties. Recall again that Passport will build a `user` object based on the return value of our `validate()` method, and attach it as a property on the `Request` object.

It's also worth pointing out that this approach leaves us room ('hooks' as it were) to inject other business logic into the process. For example, we could do a database lookup in our `validate()` method to extract more information about the user, resulting in a more enriched `user` object being available in our `Request`. This is also the place we may decide to do further token validation, such as looking up the `userId` in a list of revoked tokens, enabling us to perform token revocation. The model we've implemented here in our sample code is a fast, "stateless JWT" model, where each API call is immediately authorized based on the presence of a valid JWT, and a small bit of information about the requester (its `userId` and `username`) is available in our Request pipeline.

Add the new `JwtStrategy` as a provider in the `AuthModule`:

```typescript
@@filename(auth/auth.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';
import { LocalStrategy } from './local.strategy';
import { JwtStrategy } from './jwt.strategy';
import { UsersModule } from '../users/users.module';
import { PassportModule } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { JwtModule } from '@nestjs/jwt';
import { jwtConstants } from './constants';

@Module({
  imports: [
    UsersModule,
    PassportModule,
    JwtModule.register({
      secret: jwtConstants.secret,
      signOptions: { expiresIn: '60s' },
    }),
  ],
  providers: [AuthService, LocalStrategy, JwtStrategy],
  exports: [AuthService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
@@switch
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';
import { LocalStrategy } from './local.strategy';
import { JwtStrategy } from './jwt.strategy';
import { UsersModule } from '../users/users.module';
import { PassportModule } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { JwtModule } from '@nestjs/jwt';
import { jwtConstants } from './constants';

@Module({
  imports: [
    UsersModule,
    PassportModule,
    JwtModule.register({
      secret: jwtConstants.secret,
      signOptions: { expiresIn: '60s' },
    }),
  ],
  providers: [AuthService, LocalStrategy, JwtStrategy],
  exports: [AuthService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
```

By importing the same secret used when we signed the JWT, we ensure that the **verify** phase performed by Passport, and the **sign** phase performed in our AuthService, use a common secret.

Finally, we define the `JwtAuthGuard` class which extends the built-in `AuthGuard`:

```typescript
@@filename(auth/jwt-auth.guard)
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';

@Injectable()
export class JwtAuthGuard extends AuthGuard('jwt') {}
```

#### Implement protected route and JWT strategy guards

We can now implement our protected route and its associated Guard.

Open the `app.controller.ts` file and update it as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename(app.controller)
import { Controller, Get, Request, Post, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';
import { JwtAuthGuard } from './auth/jwt-auth.guard';
import { LocalAuthGuard } from './auth/local-auth.guard';
import { AuthService } from './auth/auth.service';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService) {}

  @UseGuards(LocalAuthGuard)
  @Post('auth/login')
  async login(@Request() req) {
    return this.authService.login(req.user);
  }

  @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
  @Get('profile')
  getProfile(@Request() req) {
    return req.user;
  }
}
@@switch
import { Controller, Dependencies, Bind, Get, Request, Post, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';
import { JwtAuthGuard } from './auth/jwt-auth.guard';
import { LocalAuthGuard } from './auth/local-auth.guard';
import { AuthService } from './auth/auth.service';

@Dependencies(AuthService)
@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(authService) {
    this.authService = authService;
  }

  @UseGuards(LocalAuthGuard)
  @Post('auth/login')
  @Bind(Request())
  async login(req) {
    return this.authService.login(req.user);
  }

  @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
  @Get('profile')
  @Bind(Request())
  getProfile(req) {
    return req.user;
  }
}
```

Once again, we're applying the `AuthGuard` that the `@nestjs/passport` module has automatically provisioned for us when we configured the passport-jwt module. This Guard is referenced by its default name, `jwt`. When our `GET /profile` route is hit, the Guard will automatically invoke our passport-jwt custom configured logic, validating the JWT, and assigning the `user` property to the `Request` object.

Ensure the app is running, and test the routes using `cURL`.

```bash
$ # GET /profile
$ curl http://localhost:3000/profile
$ # result -> {"statusCode":401,"error":"Unauthorized"}

$ # POST /auth/login
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login -d '{"username": "john", "password": "changeme"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
$ # result -> {"access_token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2Vybm... }

$ # GET /profile using access_token returned from previous step as bearer code
$ curl http://localhost:3000/profile -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2Vybm..."
$ # result -> {"userId":1,"username":"john"}
```

Note that in the `AuthModule`, we configured the JWT to have an expiration of `60 seconds`. This is probably too short an expiration, and dealing with the details of token expiration and refresh is beyond the scope of this article. However, we chose that to demonstrate an important quality of JWTs and the passport-jwt strategy. If you wait 60 seconds after authenticating before attempting a `GET /profile` request, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response. This is because Passport automatically checks the JWT for its expiration time, saving you the trouble of doing so in your application.

We've now completed our JWT authentication implementation. JavaScript clients (such as Angular/React/Vue), and other JavaScript apps, can now authenticate and communicate securely with our API Server. You can find a complete version of the code in this chapter [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/19-auth-jwt).

<app-banner-enterprise></app-banner-enterprise>

#### Default strategy

In our `AppController`, we pass the name of the strategy in the `AuthGuard()` function. We need to do this because we've introduced **two** Passport strategies (passport-local and passport-jwt), both of which supply implementations of various Passport components. Passing the name disambiguates which implementation we're linking to. When multiple strategies are included in an application, we can declare a default strategy so that we no longer have to pass the name in the `AuthGuard` function if using that default strategy. Here's how to register a default strategy when importing the `PassportModule`. This code would go in the `AuthModule`:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';
import { LocalStrategy } from './local.strategy';
import { UsersModule } from '../users/users.module';
import { PassportModule } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { JwtModule } from '@nestjs/jwt';
import { jwtConstants } from './constants';
import { JwtStrategy } from './jwt.strategy';

@Module({
  imports: [
    PassportModule.register({ defaultStrategy: 'jwt' }),
    JwtModule.register({
      secret: jwtConstants.secret,
      signOptions: { expiresIn: '60s' },
    }),
    UsersModule,
  ],
  providers: [AuthService, LocalStrategy, JwtStrategy],
  exports: [AuthService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
```

#### Request-scoped strategies

The passport API is based on registering strategies to the global instance of the library. Therefore strategies are not designed to have request-dependent options or to be dynamically instantiated per request (read more about the [request-scoped](/fundamentals/injection-scopes) providers). When you configure your strategy to be request-scoped, Nest will never instantiate it since it's not tied to any specific route. There is no physical way to determine which "request-scoped" strategies should be executed per request.

However, there are ways to dynamically resolve request-scoped providers within the strategy. For this, we leverage the [module reference](/fundamentals/module-ref) feature.

First, open the `local.strategy.ts` file and inject the `ModuleRef` in the normal way:

```typescript
constructor(private moduleRef: ModuleRef) {
  super({
    passReqToCallback: true,
  });
}
```

> info **Hint** The `ModuleRef` class is imported from the `@nestjs/core` package.

Be sure to set the `passReqToCallback` configuration property to `true`, as shown above.

In the next step, the request instance will be used to obtain the current context identifier, instead of generating a new one (read more about request context [here](/fundamentals/module-ref#getting-current-sub-tree)).

Now, inside the `validate()` method of the `LocalStrategy` class, use the `getByRequest()` method of the `ContextIdFactory` class to create a context id based on the request object, and pass this to the `resolve()` call:

```typescript
async validate(
  request: Request,
  username: string,
  password: string,
) {
  const contextId = ContextIdFactory.getByRequest(request);
  // "AuthService" is a request-scoped provider
  const authService = await this.moduleRef.resolve(AuthService, contextId);
  ...
}
```

In the example above, the `resolve()` method will asynchronously return the request-scoped instance of the `AuthService` provider (we assumed that `AuthService` is marked as a request-scoped provider).

#### Extending guards

In most cases, using a provided `AuthGuard` class is sufficient. However, there might be use-cases when you would like to simply extend the default error handling or authentication logic. For this, you can extend the built-in class and override methods within a sub-class.

```typescript
import {
  ExecutionContext,
  Injectable,
  UnauthorizedException,
} from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';

@Injectable()
export class JwtAuthGuard extends AuthGuard('jwt') {
  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext) {
    // Add your custom authentication logic here
    // for example, call super.logIn(request) to establish a session.
    return super.canActivate(context);
  }

  handleRequest(err, user, info) {
    // You can throw an exception based on either "info" or "err" arguments
    if (err || !user) {
      throw err || new UnauthorizedException();
    }
    return user;
  }
}
```

#### Customize Passport

Any standard Passport customization options can be passed the same way, using the `register()` method. The available options depend on the strategy being implemented. For example:

```typescript
PassportModule.register({ session: true });
```

You can also pass strategies an options object in their constructors to configure them.
For the local strategy you can pass e.g.:

```typescript
constructor(private authService: AuthService) {
  super({
    usernameField: 'email',
    passwordField: 'password',
  });
}
```

Take a look at the official [Passport Website](http://www.passportjs.org/docs/oauth/) for property names.

#### Named strategies

When implementing a strategy, you can provide a name for it by passing a second argument to the `PassportStrategy` function. If you don't do this, each strategy will have a default name (e.g., 'jwt' for jwt-strategy):

```typescript
export class JwtStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy, 'myjwt')
```

Then, you refer to this via a decorator like `@UseGuards(AuthGuard('myjwt'))`.

#### GraphQL

In order to use an AuthGuard with [GraphQL](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start), extend the built-in AuthGuard class and override the getRequest() method.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class GqlAuthGuard extends AuthGuard('jwt') {
  getRequest(context: ExecutionContext) {
    const ctx = GqlExecutionContext.create(context);
    return ctx.getContext().req;
  }
}
```

To use the above construct, be sure to pass the request (`req`) object as part of the context value in the GraphQL Module settings:

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot({
  context: ({ req }) => ({ req }),
});
```

To get the current authenticated user in your graphql resolver, you can define a `@CurrentUser()` decorator:

```typescript
import { createParamDecorator, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';
import { GqlExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/graphql';

export const CurrentUser = createParamDecorator(
  (data: unknown, context: ExecutionContext) => {
    const ctx = GqlExecutionContext.create(context);
    return ctx.getContext().req.user;
  },
);
```

To use above decorator in your resolver, be sure to include it as a parameter of your query or mutation:

```typescript
@Query(returns => User)
@UseGuards(GqlAuthGuard)
whoAmI(@CurrentUser() user: User) {
  return this.usersService.findById(user.id);
}
```
### Database <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/database"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="database" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Nest is database agnostic, allowing you to easily integrate with any SQL or NoSQL database. You have a number of options available to you, depending on your preferences. At the most general level, connecting Nest to a database is simply a matter of loading an appropriate Node.js driver for the database, just as you would with [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/database-integration.html) or Fastify.

You can also directly use any general purpose Node.js database integration **library** or ORM, such as [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) (navigate to the [Sequelize integration](/techniques/database#sequelize-integration) section), [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/) ([tutorial](https://dev.to/nestjs/build-a-nestjs-module-for-knex-js-or-other-resource-based-libraries-in-5-minutes-12an)) [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm), and [Prisma](https://www.github.com/prisma/prisma) ([recipe](/recipes/prisma)) , to operate at a higher level of abstraction.

For convenience, Nest provides tight integration with TypeORM and Sequelize out-of-the-box with the `@nestjs/typeorm` and `@nestjs/sequelize` packages respectively, which we'll cover in the current chapter, and Mongoose with `@nestjs/mongoose`, which is covered in [this chapter](/techniques/mongodb). These integrations provide additional NestJS-specific features, such as model/repository injection, testability, and asynchronous configuration to make accessing your chosen database even easier.

#### TypeORM Integration

For integrating with SQL and NoSQL databases, Nest provides the `@nestjs/typeorm` package. Nest uses [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) because it's the most mature Object Relational Mapper (ORM) available for TypeScript. Since it's written in TypeScript, it integrates well with the Nest framework.

To begin using it, we first install the required dependencies. In this chapter, we'll demonstrate using the popular [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) Relational DBMS, but TypeORM provides support for many relational databases, such as PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, and even NoSQL databases like MongoDB. The procedure we walk through in this chapter will be the same for any database supported by TypeORM. You'll simply need to install the associated client API libraries for your selected database.

```bash
$ npm install --save @nestjs/typeorm typeorm mysql
```

Once the installation process is complete, we can import the `TypeOrmModule` into the root `AppModule`.

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TypeOrmModule } from '@nestjs/typeorm';

@Module({
  imports: [
    TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
      type: 'mysql',
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 3306,
      username: 'root',
      password: 'root',
      database: 'test',
      entities: [],
      synchronize: true,
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The `forRoot()` method supports all the configuration properties exposed by the `createConnection()` function from the [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/connection-options) package. In addition, there are several extra configuration properties described below.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>retryAttempts</code></td>
    <td>Number of attempts to connect to the database (default: <code>10</code>)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>retryDelay</code></td>
    <td>Delay between connection retry attempts (ms) (default: <code>3000</code>)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>autoLoadEntities</code></td>
    <td>If <code>true</code>, entities will be loaded automatically (default: <code>false</code>)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>keepConnectionAlive</code></td>
    <td>If <code>true</code>, connection will not be closed on application shutdown (default: <code>false</code>)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

> info **Hint** Learn more about the connection options [here](https://typeorm.io/#/connection-options).

Alternatively, rather than passing a configuration object to `forRoot()`, we can create an `ormconfig.json` file in the project root directory.

```json
{
  "type": "mysql",
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 3306,
  "username": "root",
  "password": "root",
  "database": "test",
  "entities": ["dist/**/*.entity{.ts,.js}"],
  "synchronize": true
}
```

Then, we can call `forRoot()` without any options:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TypeOrmModule } from '@nestjs/typeorm';

@Module({
  imports: [TypeOrmModule.forRoot()],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> info **Warning** Static glob paths (e.g., `dist/**/*.entity{{ '{' }} .ts,.js{{ '}' }}`) won't work properly with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

> warning **Warning** Note that the `ormconfig.json` file is loaded by the `typeorm` library. Thus, any of the extra properties described above (which are supported internally by way of the `forRoot()` method - for example, `autoLoadEntities` and `retryDelay`) won't be applied.

Once this is done, the TypeORM `Connection` and `EntityManager` objects will be available to inject across the entire project (without needing to import any modules), for example:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Connection } from 'typeorm';

@Module({
  imports: [TypeOrmModule.forRoot(), UsersModule],
})
export class AppModule {
  constructor(private connection: Connection) {}
}
@@switch
import { Connection } from 'typeorm';

@Dependencies(Connection)
@Module({
  imports: [TypeOrmModule.forRoot(), UsersModule],
})
export class AppModule {
  constructor(connection) {
    this.connection = connection;
  }
}
```

##### Repository pattern

[TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) supports the **repository design pattern**, so each entity has its own repository. These repositories can be obtained from the database connection.

To continue the example, we need at least one entity. Let's define the `User` entity.

```typescript
@@filename(user.entity)
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  firstName: string;

  @Column()
  lastName: string;

  @Column({ default: true })
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

> info **Hint** Learn more about entities¬†in the [TypeORM documentation](https://typeorm.io/#/entities).

The `User` entity file sits in the `users` directory. This directory contains all files related to the `UsersModule`. You can decide where to keep your model files, however, we recommend creating them near their **domain**, in the corresponding module directory.

To begin using the `User` entity, we need to let TypeORM know about it by inserting it into the `entities` array in the module `forRoot()` method options (unless you use a static glob path):

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TypeOrmModule } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
import { User } from './users/user.entity';

@Module({
  imports: [
    TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
      type: 'mysql',
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 3306,
      username: 'root',
      password: 'root',
      database: 'test',
      entities: [User],
      synchronize: true,
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Next, let's look at the `UsersModule`:

```typescript
@@filename(users.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TypeOrmModule } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
import { UsersService } from './users.service';
import { UsersController } from './users.controller';
import { User } from './user.entity';

@Module({
  imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([User])],
  providers: [UsersService],
  controllers: [UsersController],
})
export class UsersModule {}
```

This module uses the `forFeature()` method to define which repositories are registered in the current scope. With that in place, we can inject the `UsersRepository` into the `UsersService` using the `@InjectRepository()` decorator:

```typescript
@@filename(users.service)
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectRepository } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
import { Repository } from 'typeorm';
import { User } from './user.entity';

@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  constructor(
    @InjectRepository(User)
    private usersRepository: Repository<User>,
  ) {}

  findAll(): Promise<User[]> {
    return this.usersRepository.find();
  }

  findOne(id: string): Promise<User> {
    return this.usersRepository.findOne(id);
  }

  async remove(id: string): Promise<void> {
    await this.usersRepository.delete(id);
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable, Dependencies } from '@nestjs/common';
import { getRepositoryToken } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
import { User } from './user.entity';

@Injectable()
@Dependencies(getRepositoryToken(User))
export class UsersService {
  constructor(usersRepository) {
    this.usersRepository = usersRepository;
  }

  findAll() {
    return this.usersRepository.find();
  }

  findOne(id) {
    return this.usersRepository.findOne(id);
  }

  async remove(id) {
    await this.usersRepository.delete(id);
  }
}
```

> warning **Notice** Don't forget to import the `UsersModule` into the root `AppModule`.

If you want to use the repository outside of the module which imports `TypeOrmModule.forFeature`, you'll need to re-export the providers generated by it.
You can do this by exporting the whole module, like this:

```typescript
@@filename(users.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TypeOrmModule } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
import { User } from './user.entity';

@Module({
  imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([User])],
  exports: [TypeOrmModule]
})
export class UsersModule {}
```

Now if we import `UsersModule` in `UserHttpModule`, we can use `@InjectRepository(User)` in the providers of the latter module.

```typescript
@@filename(users-http.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UsersModule } from './user.module';
import { UsersService } from './users.service';
import { UsersController } from './users.controller';

@Module({
  imports: [UsersModule],
  providers: [UsersService],
  controllers: [UsersController]
})
export class UserHttpModule {}
```

#### Relations

Relations are associations established between two or more tables. Relations are based on common fields from each table, often involving primary and foreign keys.

There are three types of relations:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>One-to-one</code></td>
    <td>Every row in the primary table has one and only one associated row in the foreign table.  Use the <code>@OneToOne()</code> decorator to define this type of relation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>One-to-many / Many-to-one</code></td>
    <td>Every row in the primary table has one or more related rows in the foreign table. Use the <code>@OneToMany()</code> and <code>@ManyToOne()</code> decorators to define this type of relation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Many-to-many</code></td>
    <td>Every row in the primary table has many related rows in the foreign table, and every record in the foreign table has many related rows in the primary table. Use the <code>@ManyToMany()</code> decorator to define this type of relation.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

To define relations in entities, use the corresponding **decorators**. For example, to define that each `User` can have multiple photos, use the `@OneToMany()` decorator.

```typescript
@@filename(user.entity)
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, OneToMany } from 'typeorm';
import { Photo } from '../photos/photo.entity';

@Entity()
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  firstName: string;

  @Column()
  lastName: string;

  @Column({ default: true })
  isActive: boolean;

  @OneToMany(type => Photo, photo => photo.user)
  photos: Photo[];
}
```

> info **Hint** To learn more about relations in TypeORM, visit the [TypeORM documentation](https://typeorm.io/#/relations).

##### Auto-load entities

Manually adding entities to the `entities` array of the connection options can be tedious. In addition, referencing entities from the root module breaks application domain boundaries and causes leaking implementation details to other parts of the application. To solve this issue, static glob paths can be used (e.g., `dist/**/*.entity{{ '{' }} .ts,.js{{ '}' }}`).

Note, however, that glob paths are not supported by webpack, so if you are building your application within a monorepo, you won't be able to use them. To address this issue, an alternative solution is provided. To automatically load entities, set the `autoLoadEntities` property of the configuration object (passed into the `forRoot()` method) to `true`, as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TypeOrmModule } from '@nestjs/typeorm';

@Module({
  imports: [
    TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
      ...
      autoLoadEntities: true,
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

With that option specified, every entity registered through the `forFeature()` method will be automatically added to the `entities` array of the configuration object.

> warning **Warning** Note that entities that aren't registered through the `forFeature()` method, but are only referenced from the entity (via a relationship), won't be included by way of the `autoLoadEntities` setting.

##### Separating entity definition

You can define an entity and its columns right in the model, using decorators. But some people prefer to define entities and their columns inside separate files using the ["entity schemas"](https://typeorm.io/#/separating-entity-definition).

```typescript
import { EntitySchema } from 'typeorm';
import { User } from './user.entity';

export const UserSchema = new EntitySchema<User>({
  name: 'User',
  target: User,
  columns: {
    id: {
      type: Number,
      primary: true,
      generated: true,
    },
    firstName: {
      type: String,
    },
    lastName: {
      type: String,
    },
    isActive: {
      type: Boolean,
      default: true,
    },
  },
  relations: {
    photos: {
      type: 'one-to-many',
      target: 'Photo', // the name of the PhotoSchema
    },
  },
});
```

> warning error **Warning** If you provide the `target` option, the `name` option value has to be the same as the name of the target class.
> If you do not provide the `target` you can use any name.

Nest allows you to use an `EntitySchema` instance wherever an `Entity` is expected, for example:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TypeOrmModule } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
import { UserSchema } from './user.schema';
import { UsersController } from './users.controller';
import { UsersService } from './users.service';

@Module({
  imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([UserSchema])],
  providers: [UsersService],
  controllers: [UsersController],
})
export class UsersModule {}
```

##### Transactions

A database transaction symbolizes a unit of work performed within a database management system against a database, and treated in a coherent and reliable way independent of other transactions. A transaction generally represents any change in a database ([learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction)).

There are many different strategies to handle [TypeORM transactions](https://typeorm.io/#/transactions). We recommend using the `QueryRunner` class because it gives full control over the transaction.

First, we need to inject the `Connection` object into a class in the normal way:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  constructor(private connection: Connection) {}
}
```

> info **Hint** The `Connection` class is imported from the `typeorm` package.

Now, we can use this object to create a transaction.

```typescript
async createMany(users: User[]) {
  const queryRunner = this.connection.createQueryRunner();

  await queryRunner.connect();
  await queryRunner.startTransaction();
  try {
    await queryRunner.manager.save(users[0]);
    await queryRunner.manager.save(users[1]);

    await queryRunner.commitTransaction();
  } catch (err) {
    // since we have errors lets rollback the changes we made
    await queryRunner.rollbackTransaction();
  } finally {
    // you need to release a queryRunner which was manually instantiated
    await queryRunner.release();
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** Note that the `connection` is used only to create the `QueryRunner`. However, to test this class would require mocking the entire `Connection` object (which exposes several methods). Thus, we recommend using a helper factory class (e.g., `QueryRunnerFactory`) and defining an interface with a limited set of methods required to maintain transactions. This technique makes mocking these methods pretty straightforward.

Alternatively, you can use the callback-style approach with the `transaction` method of the `Connection` object ([read more](https://typeorm.io/#/transactions/creating-and-using-transactions)).

```typescript
async createMany(users: User[]) {
  await this.connection.transaction(async manager => {
    await manager.save(users[0]);
    await manager.save(users[1]);
  });
}
```

Using decorators to control the transaction (`@Transaction()` and `@TransactionManager()`) is not recommended.

##### Subscribers

With TypeORM [subscribers](https://typeorm.io/#/listeners-and-subscribers/what-is-a-subscriber), you can listen to specific entity events.

```typescript
import {
  Connection,
  EntitySubscriberInterface,
  EventSubscriber,
  InsertEvent,
} from 'typeorm';
import { User } from './user.entity';

@EventSubscriber()
export class UserSubscriber implements EntitySubscriberInterface<User> {
  constructor(connection: Connection) {
    connection.subscribers.push(this);
  }

  listenTo() {
    return User;
  }

  beforeInsert(event: InsertEvent<User>) {
    console.log(`BEFORE USER INSERTED: `, event.entity);
  }
}
```

> error **Warning** Event subscribers can not be [request-scoped](/fundamentals/injection-scopes).

Now, add the `UserSubscriber` class to the `providers` array:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TypeOrmModule } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
import { User } from './user.entity';
import { UsersController } from './users.controller';
import { UsersService } from './users.service';
import { UserSubscriber } from './user.subscriber';

@Module({
  imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([User])],
  providers: [UsersService, UserSubscriber],
  controllers: [UsersController],
})
export class UsersModule {}
```

> info **Hint** Learn more about entity subscribers [here](https://typeorm.io/#/listeners-and-subscribers/what-is-a-subscriber).

##### Migrations

[Migrations](https://typeorm.io/#/migrations) provide a way to incrementally update the database schema to keep it in sync with the application's data model while preserving existing data in the database. To generate, run, and revert migrations, TypeORM provides a dedicated [CLI](https://typeorm.io/#/migrations/creating-a-new-migration).

Migration classes are separate from the Nest application source code. Their lifecycle is maintained by the TypeORM CLI. Therefore, you are not able to leverage dependency injection and other Nest specific features with migrations. To learn more about migrations, follow the guide in the [TypeORM documentation](https://typeorm.io/#/migrations/creating-a-new-migration).

##### Multiple databases

Some projects require multiple database connections. This can also be achieved with this module. To work with multiple connections, first create the connections. In this case, connection naming becomes **mandatory**.

Suppose you have an `Album` entity stored in its own database.

```typescript
const defaultOptions = {
  type: 'postgres',
  port: 5432,
  username: 'user',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'db',
  synchronize: true,
};

@Module({
  imports: [
    TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
      ...defaultOptions,
      host: 'user_db_host',
      entities: [User],
    }),
    TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
      ...defaultOptions,
      name: 'albumsConnection',
      host: 'album_db_host',
      entities: [Album],
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> warning **Notice** If you don't set the `name` for a connection, its name is set to `default`. Please note that you shouldn't have multiple connections without a name, or with the same name, otherwise they will get overridden.

At this point, you have `User` and `Album` entities registered with their own connection. With this setup, you have to tell the `TypeOrmModule.forFeature()` method and the `@InjectRepository()` decorator which connection should be used. If you do not pass any connection name, the `default` connection is used.

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [
    TypeOrmModule.forFeature([User]),
    TypeOrmModule.forFeature([Album], 'albumsConnection'),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

You can also inject the `Connection` or `EntityManager` for a given connection:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AlbumsService {
  constructor(
    @InjectConnection('albumsConnection')
    private connection: Connection,
    @InjectEntityManager('albumsConnection')
    private entityManager: EntityManager,
  ) {}
}
```

##### Testing

When it comes to unit testing an application, we usually want to avoid making a database connection, keeping our test suites independent and their execution process as fast as possible. But our classes might depend on repositories that are pulled from the connection instance. How do we handle that? The solution is to create mock repositories. In order to achieve that, we set up [custom providers](/fundamentals/custom-providers). Each registered repository is automatically represented by an `<EntityName>Repository` token, where `EntityName` is the name of your entity class.

The `@nestjs/typeorm` package exposes the `getRepositoryToken()` function which returns a prepared token based on a given entity.

```typescript
@Module({
  providers: [
    UsersService,
    {
      provide: getRepositoryToken(User),
      useValue: mockRepository,
    },
  ],
})
export class UsersModule {}
```

Now a substitute `mockRepository` will be used as the `UsersRepository`. Whenever any class asks for `UsersRepository` using an `@InjectRepository()` decorator, Nest will use the registered `mockRepository` object.

##### Custom repository

TypeORM provides a feature called **custom repositories**. Custom repositories allow you to extend a base repository class, and enrich it with several special methods. To learn more about this feature, visit [this page](https://typeorm.io/#/custom-repository).

In order to create your custom repository, use the `@EntityRepository()` decorator and extend the `Repository` class.

```typescript
@EntityRepository(Author)
export class AuthorRepository extends Repository<Author> {}
```

> info **Hint** Both `@EntityRepository()` and `Repository` are imported from the `typeorm` package.

Once the class is created, the next step is to delegate instantiation responsibility to Nest. For this, we have to pass the`AuthorRepository` class to the `TypeOrm.forFeature()` method.

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([AuthorRepository])],
  controller: [AuthorController],
  providers: [AuthorService],
})
export class AuthorModule {}
```

Afterward, simply inject the repository using the following construction:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AuthorService {
  constructor(private authorRepository: AuthorRepository) {}
}
```

##### Async configuration

You may want to pass your repository module options asynchronously instead of statically. In this case, use the `forRootAsync()` method, which provides several ways to deal with async configuration.

One approach is to use a factory function:

```typescript
TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync({
  useFactory: () => ({
    type: 'mysql',
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 3306,
    username: 'root',
    password: 'root',
    database: 'test',
    entities: [__dirname + '/**/*.entity{.ts,.js}'],
    synchronize: true,
  }),
});
```

Our factory behaves like any other [asynchronous provider](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/async-providers) (e.g., it can be `async` and it's able to inject dependencies through `inject`).

```typescript
TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useFactory: (configService: ConfigService) => ({
    type: 'mysql',
    host: configService.get('HOST'),
    port: +configService.get<number>('PORT'),
    username: configService.get('USERNAME'),
    password: configService.get('PASSWORD'),
    database: configService.get('DATABASE'),
    entities: [__dirname + '/**/*.entity{.ts,.js}'],
    synchronize: true,
  }),
  inject: [ConfigService],
});
```

Alternatively, you can use the `useClass` syntax:

```typescript
TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync({
  useClass: TypeOrmConfigService,
});
```

The construction above will instantiate `TypeOrmConfigService` inside `TypeOrmModule` and use it to provide an options object by calling `createTypeOrmOptions()`. Note that this means that the `TypeOrmConfigService` has to implement the `TypeOrmOptionsFactory` interface, as shown below:

```typescript
@Injectable()
class TypeOrmConfigService implements TypeOrmOptionsFactory {
  createTypeOrmOptions(): TypeOrmModuleOptions {
    return {
      type: 'mysql',
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 3306,
      username: 'root',
      password: 'root',
      database: 'test',
      entities: [__dirname + '/**/*.entity{.ts,.js}'],
      synchronize: true,
    };
  }
}
```

In order to prevent the creation of `TypeOrmConfigService` inside `TypeOrmModule` and use a provider imported from a different module, you can use the `useExisting` syntax.

```typescript
TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useExisting: ConfigService,
});
```

This construction works the same as `useClass` with one critical difference - `TypeOrmModule` will lookup imported modules to reuse an existing `ConfigService` instead of instantiating a new one.

##### Example

A working example is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/05-sql-typeorm).

<app-banner-enterprise></app-banner-enterprise>

#### Sequelize Integration

An alternative to using TypeORM is to use the [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) ORM with the `@nestjs/sequelize` package. In addition, we leverage the [sequelize-typescript](https://github.com/RobinBuschmann/sequelize-typescript) package which provides a set of additional decorators to declaratively define entities.

To begin using it, we first install the required dependencies. In this chapter, we'll demonstrate using the popular [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) Relational DBMS, but Sequelize provides support for many relational databases, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, and MariaDB. The procedure we walk through in this chapter will be the same for any database supported by Sequelize. You'll simply need to install the associated client API libraries for your selected database.

```bash
$ npm install --save @nestjs/sequelize sequelize sequelize-typescript mysql2
$ npm install --save-dev @types/sequelize
```

Once the installation process is complete, we can import the `SequelizeModule` into the root `AppModule`.

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { SequelizeModule } from '@nestjs/sequelize';

@Module({
  imports: [
    SequelizeModule.forRoot({
      dialect: 'mysql',
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 3306,
      username: 'root',
      password: 'root',
      database: 'test',
      models: [],
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The `forRoot()` method supports all the configuration properties exposed by the Sequelize constructor ([read more](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/getting-started.html#setting-up-a-connection)). In addition, there are several extra configuration properties described below.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>retryAttempts</code></td>
    <td>Number of attempts to connect to the database (default: <code>10</code>)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>retryDelay</code></td>
    <td>Delay between connection retry attempts (ms) (default: <code>3000</code>)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>autoLoadModels</code></td>
    <td>If <code>true</code>, models will be loaded automatically (default: <code>false</code>)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>keepConnectionAlive</code></td>
    <td>If <code>true</code>, connection will not be closed on the application shutdown (default: <code>false</code>)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>synchronize</code></td>
    <td>If <code>true</code>, automatically loaded models will be synchronized (default: <code>false</code>)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Once this is done, the `Sequelize` object will be available to inject across the entire project (without needing to import any modules), for example:

```typescript
@@filename(app.service)
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Sequelize } from 'sequelize-typescript';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  constructor(private sequelize: Sequelize) {}
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Sequelize } from 'sequelize-typescript';

@Dependencies(Sequelize)
@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  constructor(sequelize) {
    this.sequelize = sequelize;
  }
}
```

##### Models

Sequelize implements the Active Record pattern. With this pattern, you use model classes directly to interact with the database. To continue the example, we need at least one model. Let's define the `User` model.

```typescript
@@filename(user.model)
import { Column, Model, Table } from 'sequelize-typescript';

@Table
export class User extends Model<User> {
  @Column
  firstName: string;

  @Column
  lastName: string;

  @Column({ defaultValue: true })
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

> info **Hint** Learn more about the available decorators [here](https://github.com/RobinBuschmann/sequelize-typescript#column).

The `User` model file sits in the `users` directory. This directory contains all files related to the `UsersModule`. You can decide where to keep your model files, however, we recommend creating them near their **domain**, in the corresponding module directory.

To begin using the `User` model, we need to let Sequelize know about it by inserting it into the `models` array in the module `forRoot()` method options:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { SequelizeModule } from '@nestjs/sequelize';
import { User } from './users/user.model';

@Module({
  imports: [
    SequelizeModule.forRoot({
      dialect: 'mysql',
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 3306,
      username: 'root',
      password: 'root',
      database: 'test',
      models: [User],
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Next, let's look at the `UsersModule`:

```typescript
@@filename(users.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { SequelizeModule } from '@nestjs/sequelize';
import { User } from './user.model';
import { UsersController } from './users.controller';
import { UsersService } from './users.service';

@Module({
  imports: [SequelizeModule.forFeature([User])],
  providers: [UsersService],
  controllers: [UsersController],
})
export class UsersModule {}
```

This module uses the `forFeature()` method to define which models are registered in the current scope. With that in place, we can inject the `UserModel` into the `UsersService` using the `@InjectModel()` decorator:

```typescript
@@filename(users.service)
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectModel } from '@nestjs/sequelize';
import { User } from './user.model';

@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  constructor(
    @InjectModel(User)
    private userModel: typeof User,
  ) {}

  async findAll(): Promise<User[]> {
    return this.userModel.findAll();
  }

  findOne(id: string): Promise<User> {
    return this.userModel.findOne({
      where: {
        id,
      },
    });
  }

  async remove(id: string): Promise<void> {
    const user = await this.findOne(id);
    await user.destroy();
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable, Dependencies } from '@nestjs/common';
import { getModelToken } from '@nestjs/sequelize';
import { User } from './user.model';

@Injectable()
@Dependencies(getModelToken(User))
export class UsersService {
  constructor(usersRepository) {
    this.usersRepository = usersRepository;
  }

  async findAll() {
    return this.userModel.findAll();
  }

  findOne(id) {
    return this.userModel.findOne({
      where: {
        id,
      },
    });
  }

  async remove(id) {
    const user = await this.findOne(id);
    await user.destroy();
  }
}
```

> warning **Notice** Don't forget to import the `UsersModule` into the root `AppModule`.

If you want to use the repository outside of the module which imports `SequelizeModule.forFeature`, you'll need to re-export the providers generated by it.
You can do this by exporting the whole module, like this:

```typescript
@@filename(users.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { SequelizeModule } from '@nestjs/sequelize';
import { User } from './user.entity';

@Module({
  imports: [SequelizeModule.forFeature([User])],
  exports: [SequelizeModule]
})
export class UsersModule {}
```

Now if we import `UsersModule` in `UserHttpModule`, we can use `@InjectModel(User)` in the providers of the latter module.

```typescript
@@filename(users-http.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { UsersModule } from './user.module';
import { UsersService } from './users.service';
import { UsersController } from './users.controller';

@Module({
  imports: [UsersModule],
  providers: [UsersService],
  controllers: [UsersController]
})
export class UserHttpModule {}
```

#### Relations

Relations are associations established between two or more tables. Relations are based on common fields from each table, often involving primary and foreign keys.

There are three types of relations:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>One-to-one</code></td>
    <td>Every row in the primary table has one and only one associated row in the foreign table</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>One-to-many / Many-to-one</code></td>
    <td>Every row in the primary table has one or more related rows in the foreign table</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Many-to-many</code></td>
    <td>Every row in the primary table has many related rows in the foreign table, and every record in the foreign table has many related rows in the primary table</td>
  </tr>
</table>

To define relations in entities, use the corresponding **decorators**. For example, to define that each `User` can have multiple photos, use the `@HasMany()` decorator.

```typescript
@@filename(user.entity)
import { Column, Model, Table, HasMany } from 'sequelize-typescript';
import { Photo } from '../photos/photo.model';

@Table
export class User extends Model<User> {
  @Column
  firstName: string;

  @Column
  lastName: string;

  @Column({ defaultValue: true })
  isActive: boolean;

  @HasMany(() => Photo)
  photos: Photo[];
}
```

> info **Hint** To learn more about associations in Sequelize, read [this](https://github.com/RobinBuschmann/sequelize-typescript#model-association) chapter.

##### Auto-load models

Manually adding models to the `models` array of the connection options can be tedious. In addition, referencing models from the root module breaks application domain boundaries and causes leaking implementation details to other parts of the application. To solve this issue, automatically load models by setting both `autoLoadModels` and `synchronize` properties of the configuration object (passed into the `forRoot()` method) to `true`, as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { SequelizeModule } from '@nestjs/sequelize';

@Module({
  imports: [
    SequelizeModule.forRoot({
      ...
      autoLoadModels: true,
      synchronize: true,
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

With that option specified, every model registered through the `forFeature()` method will be automatically added to the `models` array of the configuration object.

> warning **Warning** Note that models that aren't registered through the `forFeature()` method, but are only referenced from the model (via an association), won't be included.

##### Transactions

A database transaction symbolizes a unit of work performed within a database management system against a database, and treated in a coherent and reliable way independent of other transactions. A transaction generally represents any change in a database ([learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction)).

There are many different strategies to handle [Sequelize transactions](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/transactions.html). Below is a sample implementation of a managed transaction (auto-callback).

First, we need to inject the `Sequelize` object into a class in the normal way:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  constructor(private sequelize: Sequelize) {}
}
```

> info **Hint** The `Sequelize` class is imported from the `sequelize-typescript` package.

Now, we can use this object to create a transaction.

```typescript
async createMany() {
  try {
    await this.sequelize.transaction(async t => {
      const transactionHost = { transaction: t };

      await this.userModel.create(
          { firstName: 'Abraham', lastName: 'Lincoln' },
          transactionHost,
      );
      await this.userModel.create(
          { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Boothe' },
          transactionHost,
      );
    });
  } catch (err) {
    // Transaction has been rolled back
    // err is whatever rejected the promise chain returned to the transaction callback
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** Note that the `Sequelize` instance is used only to start the transaction. However, to test this class would require mocking the entire `Sequelize` object (which exposes several methods). Thus, we recommend using a helper factory class (e.g., `TransactionRunner`) and defining an interface with a limited set of methods required to maintain transactions. This technique makes mocking these methods pretty straightforward.

##### Migrations

[Migrations](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/migrations.html) provide a way to incrementally update the database schema to keep it in sync with the application's data model while preserving existing data in the database. To generate, run, and revert migrations, Sequelize provides a dedicated [CLI](https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/migrations.html#the-cli).

Migration classes are separate from the Nest application source code. Their lifecycle is maintained by the Sequelize CLI. Therefore, you are not able to leverage dependency injection and other Nest specific features with migrations.

};

@Module({
  imports: [
    SequelizeModule.forRoot({
      ...defaultOptions,
      host: 'user_db_host',
      models: [User],
    }),
    SequelizeModule.forRoot({
      ...defaultOptions,
      name: 'albumsConnection',
      host: 'album_db_host',
      models: [Album],
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> warning **Notice** If you don't set the `name` for a connection, its name is set to `default`. Please note that you shouldn't have multiple connections without a name, or with the same name, otherwise they will get overridden.

```typescript
@Module({

    SequelizeModule.forFeature([User]),
    SequelizeModule.forFeature([Album], 'albumsConnection'),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

You can also inject the `Sequelize` instance for a given connection:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AlbumsService {
  constructor(
    @InjectConnection('albumsConnection')
    private sequelize: Sequelize,
  ) {}
}
```

##### Testing

When it comes to unit testing an application, we usually want to avoid making a database connection, keeping our test suites independent and their execution process as fast as possible.

      useValue: mockModel,
    },
  ],
})
export class UsersModule {}
```

Now a substitute `mockModel` will be used as the `UserModel`. Whenever any class asks for `UserModel` using an `@InjectModel()` decorator, Nest will use the registered `mockModel` object.

    username: configService.get('USERNAME'),
    password: configService.get('PASSWORD'),
    database: configService.get('DATABASE'),
    models: [],
  }),
  inject: [ConfigService],
});
```

Alternatively, you can use the `useClass` syntax:

```typescript
SequelizeModule.forRootAsync({
  useClass: SequelizeConfigService,
});
```

The construction above will instantiate `SequelizeConfigService` inside `SequelizeModule` and use it to provide an options object by calling `createSequelizeOptions()`. Note that this means that the `SequelizeConfigService` has to implement the `SequelizeOptionsFactory` interface, as shown below:

```typescript
@Injectable()
class SequelizeConfigService implements SequelizeOptionsFactory {
  createSequelizeOptions(): SequelizeModuleOptions {
    return {
      dialect: 'mysql',
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 3306,
      username: 'root',
      password: 'root',
      database: 'test',
      models: [],
    };
  }
}
```

In order to prevent the creation of `SequelizeConfigService` inside `SequelizeModule` and use a provider imported from a different module, you can use the `useExisting` syntax.

```typescript
SequelizeModule.forRootAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useExisting: ConfigService,
});
```

This construction works the same as `useClass` with one critical difference - `SequelizeModule` will lookup imported modules to reuse an existing `ConfigService` instead of instantiating a new one.

##### Example

A working example is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/07-sequelize).


### Mongo <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/mongodb"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="mongodb-tk" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Nest supports two methods for integrating with the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database. You can either use the built-in [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) module described [here](/techniques/database), which has a connector for MongoDB, or use [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com), the most popular MongoDB object modeling tool. In this chapter we'll describe the latter, using the dedicated `@nestjs/mongoose` package.

Start by installing the required dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install --save @nestjs/mongoose mongoose
$ npm install --save-dev @types/mongoose
```

Once the installation process is complete, we can import the `MongooseModule` into the root `AppModule`.

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MongooseModule } from '@nestjs/mongoose';

@Module({
  imports: [MongooseModule.forRoot('mongodb://localhost/nest')],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The `forRoot()` method accepts the same configuration object as `mongoose.connect()` from the Mongoose package, as described [here](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html).

#### Model injection

With Mongoose, everything is derived from a [Schema](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html). Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection. Schemas are used to define [Models](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html). Models are responsible for creating and reading documents from the underlying MongoDB database.

Schemas can be created with NestJS decorators, or with Mongoose itself manually. Using decorators to create schemas greatly reduces boilerplate and improves overall code readability.

Let's define the `CatSchema`:

```typescript
@@filename(schemas/cat.schema)
import { Prop, Schema, SchemaFactory } from '@nestjs/mongoose';
import { Document } from 'mongoose';

export type CatDocument = Cat & Document;

@Schema()
export class Cat {
  @Prop()
  name: string;

  @Prop()
  age: number;

  @Prop()
  breed: string;
}

export const CatSchema = SchemaFactory.createForClass(Cat);
```

> info **Hint** Note you can also generate a raw schema definition using the `DefinitionsFactory` class (from the `nestjs/mongoose`). This allows you to manually modify the schema definition generated based on the metadata you provided. This is useful for certain edge-cases where it may be hard to represent everything with decorators.

The `@Schema()` decorator marks a class as a schema definition. It maps our `Cat` class to a MongoDB collection of the same name, but with an additional ‚Äús‚Äù at the end - so the final mongo collection name will be `cats`. This decorator accepts a single optional argument which is a schema options object. Think of it as the object you would normally pass as a second argument of the `mongoose.Schema` class' constructor (e.g., `new mongoose.Schema(_, options)`)). To learn more about available schema options, see [this](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#options) chapter.

The `@Prop()` decorator defines a property in the document. For example, in the schema definition above, we defined three properties: `name`, `age`, and `breed`. The [schema types](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html) for these properties are automatically inferred thanks to TypeScript metadata (and reflection) capabilities. However, in more complex scenarios in which types cannot be implicitly reflected (for example, arrays or nested object structures), types must be indicated explicitly, as follows:

```typescript
@Prop([String])
tags: string[];
```

Alternatively, the `@Prop()` decorator accepts an options object argument ([read more](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html#schematype-options) about the available options). With this, you can indicate whether a property is required or not, specify a default value, or mark it as immutable. For example:

```typescript
@Prop({ required: true })
name: string;
```

Finally, the **raw** schema definition can also be passed to the decorator. This is useful when, for example, a property represents a nested object which is not defined as a class. For this, use the `raw()` function from the `@nestjs/mongoose` package, as follows:

```typescript
@Prop(raw({
  firstName: { type: String },
  lastName: { type: String }
}))
details: Record<string, any>;
```

Alternatively, if you prefer **not using decorators**, you can define a schema manually. For example:

```typescript
export const CatSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  breed: String,
});
```

The `cat.schema` file resides in a folder in the `cats` directory, where we also define the `CatsModule`. While you can store schema files wherever you prefer, we recommend storing them near their related **domain** objects, in the appropriate module directory.

Let's look at the `CatsModule`:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MongooseModule } from '@nestjs/mongoose';
import { CatsController } from './cats.controller';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';
import { Cat, CatSchema } from './schemas/cat.schema';

@Module({
  imports: [MongooseModule.forFeature([{ name: Cat.name, schema: CatSchema }])],
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [CatsService],
})
export class CatsModule {}
```

The `MongooseModule` provides the `forFeature()` method to configure the module, including defining which models should be registered in the current scope. If you also want to use the models in another module, add MongooseModule to the `exports` section of `CatsModule` and import `CatsModule` in the other module.

Once you've registered the schema, you can inject a `Cat` model into the `CatsService` using the `@InjectModel()` decorator:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.service)
import { Model } from 'mongoose';
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectModel } from '@nestjs/mongoose';
import { Cat, CatDocument } from './schemas/cat.schema';
import { CreateCatDto } from './dto/create-cat.dto';

@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  constructor(@InjectModel(Cat.name) private catModel: Model<CatDocument>) {}

  async create(createCatDto: CreateCatDto): Promise<Cat> {
    const createdCat = new this.catModel(createCatDto);
    return createdCat.save();
  }

  async findAll(): Promise<Cat[]> {
    return this.catModel.find().exec();
  }
}
@@switch
import { Model } from 'mongoose';
import { Injectable, Dependencies } from '@nestjs/common';
import { getModelToken } from '@nestjs/mongoose';
import { Cat } from './schemas/cat.schema';

@Injectable()
@Dependencies(getModelToken(Cat.name))
export class CatsService {
  constructor(catModel) {
    this.catModel = catModel;
  }

  async create(createCatDto) {
    const createdCat = new this.catModel(createCatDto);
    return createdCat.save();
  }

  async findAll() {
    return this.catModel.find().exec();
  }
}
```

#### Connection

At times you may need to access the native [Mongoose Connection](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#Connection) object. For example, you may want to make native API calls on the connection object. You can inject the Mongoose Connection by using the `@InjectConnection()` decorator as follows:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectConnection } from '@nestjs/mongoose';
import { Connection } from 'mongoose';

@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  constructor(@InjectConnection() private connection: Connection) {}
}
```

#### Multiple databases

Some projects require multiple database connections. This can also be achieved with this module. To work with multiple connections, first create the connections. In this case, connection naming becomes **mandatory**.

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MongooseModule } from '@nestjs/mongoose';

@Module({
  imports: [
    MongooseModule.forRoot('mongodb://localhost/test', {
      connectionName: 'cats',
    }),
    MongooseModule.forRoot('mongodb://localhost/users', {
      connectionName: 'users',
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> warning **Notice** Please note that you shouldn't have multiple connections without a name, or with the same name, otherwise they will get overridden.

With this setup, you have to tell the `MongooseModule.forFeature()` function which connection should be used.

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [
    MongooseModule.forFeature([{ name: Cat.name, schema: CatSchema }], 'cats'),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

You can also inject the `Connection` for a given connection:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectConnection } from '@nestjs/mongoose';
import { Connection } from 'mongoose';

@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  constructor(@InjectConnection('cats') private connection: Connection) {}
}
```

#### Hooks (middleware)

Middleware (also called pre and post hooks) are functions which are passed control during execution of asynchronous functions. Middleware is specified on the schema level and is useful for writing plugins ([source](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html)). Calling `pre()` or `post()` after compiling a model does not work in Mongoose. To register a hook **before** model registration, use the `forFeatureAsync()` method of the `MongooseModule` along with a factory provider (i.e., `useFactory`). With this technique, you can access a schema object, then use the `pre()` or `post()` method to register a hook on that schema. See example below:

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [
    MongooseModule.forFeatureAsync([
      {
        name: Cat.name,
        useFactory: () => {
          const schema = CatsSchema;
          schema.pre('save', () => console.log('Hello from pre save'));
          return schema;
        },
      },
    ]),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Like other [factory providers](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers#factory-providers-usefactory), our factory function can be `async` and can inject dependencies through `inject`.

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [
    MongooseModule.forFeatureAsync([
      {
        name: Cat.name,
        imports: [ConfigModule],
        useFactory: (configService: ConfigService) => {
          const schema = CatsSchema;
          schema.pre('save', () =>
            console.log(
              `${configService.get('APP_NAME')}: Hello from pre save`,
            ),
          );
          return schema;
        },
        inject: [ConfigService],
      },
    ]),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### Plugins

To register a [plugin](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/plugins.html) for a given schema, use the `forFeatureAsync()` method.

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [
    MongooseModule.forFeatureAsync([
      {
        name: Cat.name,
        useFactory: () => {
          const schema = CatsSchema;
          schema.plugin(require('mongoose-autopopulate'));
          return schema;
        },
      },
    ]),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

To register a plugin for all schemas at once, call the `.plugin()` method of the `Connection` object. You should access the connection before models are created; to do this, use the `connectionFactory`:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MongooseModule } from '@nestjs/mongoose';

@Module({
  imports: [
    MongooseModule.forRoot('mongodb://localhost/test', {
      connectionFactory: (connection) => {
        connection.plugin(require('mongoose-autopopulate'));
        return connection;
      }
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### Testing

When unit testing an application, we usually want to avoid any database connection, making our test suites simpler to set up and faster to execute. But our classes might depend on models that are pulled from the connection instance. How do we resolve these classes? The solution is to create mock models.

To make this easier, the `@nestjs/mongoose` package exposes a `getModelToken()` function that returns a prepared [injection token](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers#di-fundamentals) based on a token name. Using this token, you can easily provide a mock implementation using any of the standard [custom provider](/fundamentals/custom-providers) techniques, including `useClass`, `useValue`, and `useFactory`. For example:

```typescript
@Module({
  providers: [
    CatsService,
    {
      provide: getModelToken(Cat.name),
      useValue: catModel,
    },
  ],
})
export class CatsModule {}
```

In this example, a hardcoded `catModel` (object instance) will be provided whenever any consumer injects a `Model<Cat>` using an `@InjectModel()` decorator.

<app-banner-courses></app-banner-courses>

#### Async configuration

When you need to pass module options asynchronously instead of statically, use the `forRootAsync()` method. As with most dynamic modules, Nest provides several techniques to deal with async configuration.

One technique is to use a factory function:

```typescript
MongooseModule.forRootAsync({
  useFactory: () => ({
    uri: 'mongodb://localhost/nest',
  }),
});
```

Like other [factory providers](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers#factory-providers-usefactory), our factory function can be `async` and can inject dependencies through `inject`.

```typescript
MongooseModule.forRootAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useFactory: async (configService: ConfigService) => ({
    uri: configService.get<string>('MONGODB_URI'),
  }),
  inject: [ConfigService],
});
```

Alternatively, you can configure the `MongooseModule` using a class instead of a factory, as shown below:

```typescript
MongooseModule.forRootAsync({
  useClass: MongooseConfigService,
});
```

The construction above instantiates `MongooseConfigService` inside `MongooseModule`, using it to create the required options object. Note that in this example, the `MongooseConfigService` has to implement the `MongooseOptionsFactory` interface, as shown below. The `MongooseModule` will call the `createMongooseOptions()` method on the instantiated object of the supplied class.

```typescript
@Injectable()
class MongooseConfigService implements MongooseOptionsFactory {
  createMongooseOptions(): MongooseModuleOptions {
    return {
      uri: 'mongodb://localhost/nest',
    };
  }
}
```

If you want to reuse an existing options provider instead of creating a private copy inside the `MongooseModule`, use the `useExisting` syntax.

```typescript
MongooseModule.forRootAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useExisting: ConfigService,
});
```

#### Example

A working example is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/06-mongoose).
### Configuration <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="configuration" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Applications often run in different **environments**. Depending on the environment, different configuration settings should be used. For example, usually the local environment relies on specific database credentials, valid only for the local DB instance. The production environment would use a separate set of DB credentials. Since configuration variables change, best practice is to [store configuration variables](https://12factor.net/config) in the environment.

Externally defined environment variables are visible inside Node.js through the `process.env` global. We could try to solve the problem of multiple environments by setting the environment variables separately in each environment. This can quickly get unwieldy, especially in the development and testing environments where these values need to be easily mocked and/or changed.

In Node.js applications, it's common to use `.env` files, holding key-value pairs where each key represents a particular value, to represent each environment. Running an app in different environments is then just a matter of swapping in the correct `.env` file.

A good approach for using this technique in Nest is to create a `ConfigModule` that exposes a `ConfigService` which loads the appropriate `.env` file. While you may choose to write such a module yourself, for convenience Nest provides the `@nestjs/config` package out-of-the box. We'll cover this package in the current chapter.

#### Installation

To begin using it, we first install the required dependency.

```bash
$ npm i --save @nestjs/config
```

> info **Hint** The `@nestjs/config` package internally uses [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).

#### Getting started

Once the installation process is complete, we can import the `ConfigModule`. Typically, we'll import it into the root `AppModule` and control its behavior using the `.forRoot()` static method. During this step, environment variable key/value pairs are parsed and resolved. Later, we'll see several options for accessing the `ConfigService` class of the `ConfigModule` in our other feature modules.

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigModule } from '@nestjs/config';

@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule.forRoot()],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The above code will load and parse a `.env` file from the default location (the project root directory), merge key/value pairs from the `.env` file with environment variables assigned to `process.env`, and store the result in a private structure that you can access through the `ConfigService`. The `forRoot()` method registers the `ConfigService` provider, which provides a `get()` method for reading these parsed/merged configuration variables. Since `@nestjs/config` relies on [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv), it uses that package's rules for resolving conflicts in environment variable names. When a key exists both in the runtime environment as an environment variable (e.g., via OS shell exports like `export DATABASE_USER=test`) and in a `.env` file, the runtime environment variable takes precedence.

A sample `.env` file looks something like this:

```json
DATABASE_USER=test
DATABASE_PASSWORD=test
```

#### Custom env file path

By default, the package looks for a `.env` file in the root directory of the application. To specify another path for the `.env` file, set the `envFilePath` property of an (optional) options object you pass to `forRoot()`, as follows:

```typescript
ConfigModule.forRoot({
  envFilePath: '.development.env',
});
```

You can also specify multiple paths for `.env` files like this:

```typescript
ConfigModule.forRoot({
  envFilePath: ['.env.development.local', '.env.development'],
});
```

If a variable is found in multiple files, the first one takes precedence.

#### Disable env variables loading

If you don't want to load the `.env` file, but instead would like to simply access environment variables from the runtime environment (as with OS shell exports like `export DATABASE_USER=test`), set the options object's `ignoreEnvFile` property to `true`, as follows:

```typescript
ConfigModule.forRoot({
  ignoreEnvFile: true,
});
```

#### Use module globally

When you want to use `ConfigModule` in other modules, you'll need to import it (as is standard with any Nest module). Alternatively, declare it as a [global module](https://docs.nestjs.com/modules#global-modules) by setting the options object's `isGlobal` property to `true`, as shown below. In that case, you will not need to import `ConfigModule` in other modules once it's been loaded in the root module (e.g., `AppModule`).

```typescript
ConfigModule.forRoot({
  isGlobal: true,
});
```

#### Custom configuration files

For more complex projects, you may utilize custom configuration files to return nested configuration objects. This allows you to group related configuration settings by function (e.g., database-related settings), and to store related settings in individual files to help manage them independently.

A custom configuration file exports a factory function that returns a configuration object. The configuration object can be any arbitrarily nested plain JavaScript object. The `process.env` object will contain the fully resolved environment variable key/value pairs (with `.env` file and externally defined variables resolved and merged as described <a href="techniques/configuration#getting-started">above</a>). Since you control the returned configuration object, you can add any required logic to cast values to an appropriate type, set default values, etc. For example:

```typescript
@@filename(config/configuration)
export default () => ({
  port: parseInt(process.env.PORT, 10) || 3000,
  database: {
    host: process.env.DATABASE_HOST,
    port: parseInt(process.env.DATABASE_PORT, 10) || 5432
  }
});
```

We load this file using the `load` property of the options object we pass to the `ConfigModule.forRoot()` method:

```typescript
import configuration from './config/configuration';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ConfigModule.forRoot({
      load: [configuration],
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> info **Notice** The value assigned to the `load` property is an array, allowing you to load multiple configuration files (e.g. `load: [databaseConfig, authConfig]`)

<app-banner-enterprise></app-banner-enterprise>

#### Using the `ConfigService`

To access configuration values from our `ConfigService`, we first need to inject `ConfigService`. As with any provider, we need to import its containing module - the `ConfigModule` - into the module that will use it (unless you set the `isGlobal` property in the options object passed to the `ConfigModule.forRoot()` method to `true`). Import it into a feature module as shown below.

```typescript
@@filename(feature.module)
@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  // ...
})
```

Then we can inject it using standard constructor injection:

```typescript
constructor(private configService: ConfigService) {}
```

And use it in our class:

```typescript
// get an environment variable
const dbUser = this.configService.get<string>('DATABASE_USER');

// get a custom configuration value
const dbHost = this.configService.get<string>('database.host');
```

As shown above, use the `configService.get()` method to get a simple environment variable by passing the variable name. You can do TypeScript type hinting by passing the type, as shown above (e.g., `get<string>(...)`). The `get()` method can also traverse a nested custom configuration object (created via a <a href="techniques/configuration#custom-configuration-files">Custom configuration file</a>), as shown in the second example above.

You can also get the whole nested custom configuration object using an interface as the type hint:

```typescript
interface DatabaseConfig {
  host: string;
  port: number;
}

const dbConfig = this.configService.get<DatabaseConfig>('database');

// you can now use `dbConfig.port` and `dbConfig.host`
const port = dbConfig.port;
```

The `get()` method also takes an optional second argument defining a default value, which will be returned when the key doesn't exist, as shown below:

```typescript
// use "localhost" when "database.host" is not defined
const dbHost = this.configService.get<string>('database.host', 'localhost');
```

`ConfigService` has an optional generic (type argument) to help prevent accessing a config property that does not exist. Use it as shown below:

```typescript
interface EnvironmentVariables {
  PORT: number;
  TIMEOUT: string;
}

// somewhere in the code
constructor(private configService: ConfigService<EnvironmentVariables>) {
  // this is valid
  const port = this.configService.get<number>('PORT');

  // this is invalid as URL is not a property on the EnvironmentVariables interface
  const url = this.configService.get<string>('URL');
}
```

> warning **Notice** If you have nested properties in your config, like in the `database.host` example above,  the interface must have a matching `'database.host': string;` property.  Otherwise a TypeScript error will be thrown.

#### Configuration namespaces

The `ConfigModule` allows you to define and load multiple custom configuration files, as shown in <a href="techniques/configuration#custom-configuration-files">Custom configuration files</a> above. You can manage complex configuration object hierarchies with nested configuration objects as shown in that section. Alternatively, you can return a "namespaced" configuration object with the `registerAs()` function as follows:

```typescript
@@filename(config/database.config)
export default registerAs('database', () => ({
  host: process.env.DATABASE_HOST,
  port: process.env.DATABASE_PORT || 5432
}));
```

As with custom configuration files, inside your `registerAs()` factory function, the `process.env` object will contain the fully resolved environment variable key/value pairs (with `.env` file and externally defined variables resolved and merged as described <a href="techniques/configuration#getting-started">above</a>).

> info **Hint** The `registerAs` function is exported from the `@nestjs/config` package.

Load a namespaced configuration with the `load` property of the `forRoot()` method's options object, in the same way you load a custom configuration file:

```typescript
import databaseConfig from './config/database.config';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ConfigModule.forRoot({
      load: [databaseConfig],
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Now, to get the `host` value from the `database` namespace, use dot notation. Use `'database'` as the prefix to the property name, corresponding to the name of the namespace (passed as the first argument to the `registerAs()` function):

```typescript
const dbHost = this.configService.get<string>('database.host');
```

A reasonable alternative is to inject the `database` namespace directly. This allows us to benefit from strong typing:

```typescript
constructor(
  @Inject(databaseConfig.KEY)
  private dbConfig: ConfigType<typeof databaseConfig>,
) {}
```

> info **Hint** The `ConfigType` is exported from the `@nestjs/config` package.

#### Partial registration

Thus far, we've processed configuration files in our root module (e.g., `AppModule`), with the `forRoot()` method. Perhaps you have a more complex project structure, with feature-specific configuration files located in multiple different directories. Rather than load all these files in the root module, the `@nestjs/config` package provides a feature called **partial registration**, which references only the configuration files associated with each feature module. Use the `forFeature()` static method within a feature module to perform this partial registration, as follows:

```typescript
import databaseConfig from './config/database.config';

@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule.forFeature(databaseConfig)],
})
export class DatabaseModule {}
```

> info **Warning** In some circumstances, you may need to access properties loaded via partial registration using the `onModuleInit()` hook, rather than in a constructor. This is because the `forFeature()` method is run during module initialization, and the order of module initialization is indeterminate. If you access values loaded this way by another module, in a constructor, the module that the configuration depends upon may not yet have initialized. The `onModuleInit()` method runs only after all modules it depends upon have been initialized, so this technique is safe.

#### Schema validation

It is standard practice to throw an exception during application startup if required environment variables haven't been provided or if they don't meet certain validation rules. The `@nestjs/config` package enables use of the [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) npm package to support this type of validation. With Joi, you define an object schema and validate JavaScript objects against it.

Install Joi (and its types, for **TypeScript** users):

```bash
$ npm install --save @hapi/joi
$ npm install --save-dev @types/hapi__joi
```

> warning **Notice** The latest version of `@hapi/joi` requires you to be running Node v12 or later. For older versions of node, please install `v16.1.8`. This is mainly after the release of `v17.0.2` which causes errors during build time. For more information, please refer to [their documentation](https://hapi.dev/family/joi/?v=17.0.2#install) & this [github issue](https://github.com/hapijs/joi/issues/2266#issuecomment-571667769).

Now we can define a Joi validation schema and pass it via the `validationSchema` property of the `forRoot()` method's options object, as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import * as Joi from '@hapi/joi';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ConfigModule.forRoot({
      validationSchema: Joi.object({
        NODE_ENV: Joi.string()
          .valid('development', 'production', 'test', 'provision')
          .default('development'),
        PORT: Joi.number().default(3000),
      }),
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

By default, all schema keys are considered optional. Here, we set default values for `NODE_ENV` and `PORT` which will be used if we don't provide these variables in the environment (`.env` file or process environment). Alternatively, we can use the `required()` validation method to require that a value must be defined in the environment (`.env` file or process environment). In this case, the validation step will throw an exception if we don't provide the variable in the environment. See [Joi validation methods](https://hapi.dev/family/joi/?v=17.0.2#example) for more on how to construct validation schemas.

By default, unknown environment variables (environment variables whose keys are not present in the schema) are allowed and do not trigger a validation exception. By default, all validation errors are reported. You can alter these behaviors by passing an options object via the `validationOptions` key of the `forRoot()` options object. This options object can contain any of the standard validation options properties provided by [Joi validation options](https://hapi.dev/family/joi/api/?v=17.0.2#anyvalidvalues---aliases-equal). For example, to reverse the two settings above, pass options like this:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import * as Joi from '@hapi/joi';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ConfigModule.forRoot({
      validationSchema: Joi.object({
        NODE_ENV: Joi.string()
          .valid('development', 'production', 'test', 'provision')
          .default('development'),
        PORT: Joi.number().default(3000),
      }),
      validationOptions: {
        allowUnknown: false,
        abortEarly: true,
      },
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The `@nestjs/config` package uses default settings of:

- `allowUnknown`: controls whether or not to allow unknown keys in the environment variables. Default is `true`
- `abortEarly`: if true, stops validation on the first error; if false, returns all errors. Defaults to `false`.

Note that once you decide to pass a `validationOptions` object, any settings you do not explicitly pass will default to `Joi` standard defaults (not the `@nestjs/config` defaults). For example, if you leave `allowUnknowns` unspecified in your custom `validationOptions` object, it will have the `Joi` default value of `false`. Hence, it is probably safest to specify **both** of these settings in your custom object.

#### Custom getter functions

`ConfigService` defines a generic `get()` method to retrieve a configuration value by key. We may also add `getter` functions to enable a little more natural coding style:

```typescript
@@filename()
@Injectable()
export class ApiConfigService {
  constructor(private configService: ConfigService) {}

  get isAuthEnabled(): boolean {
    return this.configService.get('AUTH_ENABLED') === 'true';
  }
}
@@switch
@Dependencies(ConfigService)
@Injectable()
export class ApiConfigService {
  constructor(configService) {
    this.configService = configService;
  }

  get isAuthEnabled() {
    return this.configService.get('AUTH_ENABLED') === 'true';
  }
}
```

Now we can use the getter function as follows:

```typescript
@@filename(app.service)
@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  constructor(apiConfigService: ApiConfigService) {
    if (apiConfigService.isAuthEnabled) {
      // Authentication is enabled
    }
  }
}
@@switch
@Dependencies(ApiConfigService)
@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  constructor(apiConfigService) {
    if (apiConfigService.isAuthEnabled) {
      // Authentication is enabled
    }
  }
}
```

#### Expandable variables

The `@nestjs/config` package supports environment variable expansion. With this technique, you can create nested environment variables, where one variable is referred to within the definition of another. For example:

```json
APP_URL=mywebsite.com
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@${APP_URL}
```

With this construction, the variable `SUPPORT_EMAIL` resolves to `'support@mywebsite.com'`. Note the use of the `${{ '{' }}...{{ '}' }}` syntax to trigger resolving the value of the variable `APP_URL` inside the definition of `SUPPORT_EMAIL`.

> info **Hint** For this feature, `@nestjs/config` package internally uses [dotenv-expand](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv-expand).

Enable environment variable expansion using the `expandVariables` property in the options object passed to the `forRoot()` method of the `ConfigModule`, as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
@Module({
  imports: [
    ConfigModule.forRoot({
      // ...
      expandVariables: true,
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### Using in the `main.ts`

While our config is a stored in a service, it can still be used in the `main.ts` file. This way, you can use it to store variables such as the application port or the CORS host.

To access it, you must use the `app.get()` method, followed by the service reference:

```typescript
const configService = app.get(ConfigService);
```

You can then use it as usual, by calling the `get` method with the configuration key:

```typescript
const port = configService.get('PORT');
```
### Validation <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/validation"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="validation" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

It is best practice to validate the correctness of any data sent into a web application. To automatically validate incoming requests, Nest provides several pipes available right out-of-the-box:

- `ValidationPipe`
- `ParseIntPipe`
- `ParseBoolPipe`
- `ParseArrayPipe`
- `ParseUUIDPipe`

The `ValidationPipe` makes use of the powerful [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator) package and its declarative validation decorators. The `ValidationPipe` provides a convenient approach to enforce validation rules for all incoming client payloads, where the specific rules are declared with simple annotations in local class/DTO declarations in each module.

#### Overview

In the [Pipes](/pipes) chapter, we went through the process of building simple pipes and binding them to controllers, methods or to the global app to demonstrate how the process works. Be sure to review that chapter to best understand the topics of this chapter. Here, we'll focus on various **real world** use cases of the `ValidationPipe`, and show how to use some of its advanced customization features.

#### Using the built-in ValidationPipe

> info **Hint** The `ValidationPipe` is imported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

Because this pipe uses the `class-validator` and `class-transformer` libraries, there are many options available. You configure these settings via a configuration object passed to the pipe. Following are the built-in options:

```typescript
export interface ValidationPipeOptions extends ValidatorOptions {
  transform?: boolean;
  disableErrorMessages?: boolean;
  exceptionFactory?: (errors: ValidationError[]) => any;
}
```

In addition to these, all `class-validator` options (inherited from the `ValidatorOptions` interface) are available:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Option</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>skipMissingProperties</code></td>
    <td><code>boolean</code></td>
    <td>If set to true, validator will skip validation of all properties that are missing in the validating object.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>whitelist</code></td>
    <td><code>boolean</code></td>
    <td>If set to true, validator will strip validated (returned) object of any properties that do not use any validation decorators.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>forbidNonWhitelisted</code></td>
    <td><code>boolean</code></td>
    <td>If set to true, instead of stripping non-whitelisted properties validator will throw an exception.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>forbidUnknownValues</code></td>
    <td><code>boolean</code></td>
    <td>If set to true, attempts to validate unknown objects fail immediately.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>disableErrorMessages</code></td>
    <td><code>boolean</code></td>
    <td>If set to true, validation errors will not be returned to the client.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>errorHttpStatusCode</code></td>
    <td><code>number</code></td>
    <td>This setting allows you to specify which exception type will be used in case of an error. By default it throws <code>BadRequestException</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>exceptionFactory</code></td>
    <td><code>Function</code></td>
    <td>Takes an array of the validation errors and returns an exception object to be thrown.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>groups</code></td>
    <td><code>string[]</code></td>
    <td>Groups to be used during validation of the object.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>dismissDefaultMessages</code></td>
    <td><code>boolean</code></td>
    <td>If set to true, the validation will not use default messages. Error message always will be <code>undefined</code>        if
      its not explicitly set.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>validationError.target</code></td>
    <td><code>boolean</code></td>
    <td>Indicates if target should be exposed in <code>ValidationError</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>validationError.value</code></td>
    <td><code>boolean</code></td>
    <td>Indicates if validated value should be exposed in <code>ValidationError</code>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Auto-validation

We'll start by binding `ValidationPipe` at the application level, thus ensuring all endpoints are protected from receiving incorrect data.

```typescript
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule);
  app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe());
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

To test our pipe, let's create a basic endpoint.

```typescript
@Post()
create(@Body() createUserDto: CreateUserDto) {
  return 'This action adds a new user';
}
```

> info **Hint** Since TypeScript does not store metadata about **generics or interfaces**, when you use them in your DTOs, `ValidationPipe` may not be able to properly validate incoming data.  For this reason, consider using concrete classes in your DTOs.

Now we can add a few validation rules in our `CreateUserDto`. We do this using decorators provided by the `class-validator` package, described in detail [here](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator#validation-decorators). In this fashion, any route that uses the `CreateUserDto` will automatically enforce these validation rules.

```typescript
import { IsEmail, IsNotEmpty } from 'class-validator';

export class CreateUserDto {
  @IsEmail()
  email: string;

  @IsNotEmpty()
  password: string;
}
```

With these rules in place, if a request hits our endpoint with an invalid `email` property in the request body, the application will automatically respond with a `400 Bad Request` code, along with the following response body:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": ["email must be an email"]
}
```

In addition to validating request bodies, the `ValidationPipe` can be used with other request object properties as well. Imagine that we would like to accept `:id` in the endpoint path. To ensure that only numbers are accepted for this request parameter, we can use the following construct:

```typescript
@Get(':id')
findOne(@Param() params: FindOneParams) {
  return 'This action returns a user';
}
```

`FindOneParams`, like a DTO, is simply a class that defines validation rules using `class-validator`. It would look like this:

```typescript
import { IsNumberString } from 'class-validator';

export class FindOneParams {
  @IsNumberString()
  id: number;
}
```

#### Disable detailed errors

Error messages can be helpful to explain what was incorrect in a request. However, some production environments prefer to disable detailed errors. Do this by passing an options object to the `ValidationPipe`:

```typescript
app.useGlobalPipes(
  new ValidationPipe({
    disableErrorMessages: true,
  }),
);
```

As a result, detailed error messages won't be displayed in the response body.

#### Stripping properties

Our `ValidationPipe` can also filter out properties that should not be received by the method handler. In this case, we can **whitelist** the acceptable properties, and any property not included in the whitelist is automatically stripped from the resulting object. For example, if our handler expects `email` and `password` properties, but a request also includes an `age` property, this property can be automatically removed from the resulting DTO. To enable such behavior, set `whitelist` to `true`.

```typescript
app.useGlobalPipes(
  new ValidationPipe({
    whitelist: true,
  }),
);
```

When set to true, this will automatically remove non-whitelisted properties (those without any decorator in the validation class).

Alternatively, you can stop the request from processing when non-whitelisted properties are present, and return an error response to the user. To enable this, set the `forbidNonWhitelisted` option property to `true`, in combination with setting `whitelist` to `true`.

<app-banner-courses></app-banner-courses>

#### Transform payload objects

Payloads coming in over the network are plain JavaScript objects. The `ValidationPipe` can automatically transform payloads to be objects typed according to their DTO classes. To enable auto-transformation, set `transform` to `true`.  This can be done at a method level:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.controller)
@Post()
@UsePipes(new ValidationPipe({ transform: true }))
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
```

To enable this behavior globally, set the option on a global pipe:

```typescript
app.useGlobalPipes(
  new ValidationPipe({
    transform: true,
  }),
);
```

With the auto-transformation option enabled, the `ValidationPipe` will also perform conversion of primitive types. In the following example, the `findOne()` method takes one argument which represents an extracted `id` path parameter:

```typescript
@Get(':id')
findOne(@Param('id') id: number) {
  console.log(typeof id === 'number'); // true
  return 'This action returns a user';
}
```

By default, every path parameter and query parameter comes over the network as a `string`. In the above example, we specified the `id` type as a `number` (in the method signature). Therefore, the `ValidationPipe` will try to automatically convert a string identifier to a number.

#### Explicit conversion

In the above section, we showed how the `ValidationPipe` can implicitly transform query and path parameters based on the expected type. However, this feature requires having auto-transformation enabled.

Alternatively (with auto-transformation disabled), you can explicitly cast values using the `ParseIntPipe` or `ParseBoolPipe` (note that `ParseStringPipe` is not needed because, as mentioned earlier, every path parameter and query parameter comes over the network as a `string` by default).

```typescript
@Get(':id')
findOne(
  @Param('id', ParseIntPipe) id: number,
  @Query('sort', ParseBoolPipe) sort: boolean,
) {
  console.log(typeof id === 'number'); // true
  console.log(typeof sort === 'boolean'); // true
  return 'This action returns a user';
}
```

> info **Hint** The `ParseIntPipe` and `ParseBoolPipe` are exported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

#### Parsing and validating arrays

TypeScript does not store metadata about generics or interfaces, so when you use them in your DTOs, `ValidationPipe` may not be able to properly validate incoming data. For instance, in the following code, `createUserDtos` won't be correctly validated:

```typescript
@Post()
createBulk(@Body() createUserDtos: CreateUserDto[]) {
  return 'This action adds new users';
}
```

To validate the array, create a dedicated class which contains a property that wraps the array, or use the `ParseArrayPipe`.

```typescript
@Post()
createBulk(
  @Body(new ParseArrayPipe({ items: CreateUserDto }))
  createUserDtos: CreateUserDto[],
) {
  return 'This action adds new users';
}
```

In addition, the `ParseArrayPipe` may come in handy when parsing query parameters. Let's consider a `findByIds()` method that returns users based on identifiers passed as query parameters.

```typescript
@Get()
findByIds(
  @Query('id', new ParseArrayPipe({ items: Number, separator: ',' }))
  ids: number[],
) {
  return 'This action returns users by ids';
}
```

This construction validates the incoming query parameters from an HTTP `GET` request like the following:

```bash
GET /?ids=1,2,3
```

#### WebSockets and Microservices

While this chapter shows examples using HTTP style applications (e.g., Express or Fastify), the `ValidationPipe` works the same for WebSockets and microservices, regardless of the transport method that is used.

### Caching <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="caching" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Caching is a great and simple **technique** that helps improve your app's performance. It acts as a temporary data store providing high performance data access.

#### Installation

First install the required package:

```bash
$ npm install --save cache-manager
```

#### In-memory cache

Nest provides a unified API for various cache storage providers. The built-in one is an in-memory data store. However, you can easily switch to a more comprehensive solution, like Redis. In order to enable caching, first import the `CacheModule` and call its `register()` method.

```typescript
import { CacheModule, Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';

@Module({
  imports: [CacheModule.register()],
  controllers: [AppController],
})
export class ApplicationModule {}
```

> warning **Warning** In [GraphQL](/graphql/quick-start) applications, interceptors are executed separately for each field resolver. Thus, `CacheModule` (which uses interceptors to cache responses) will not work properly.

Then just tie the `CacheInterceptor` where you want to cache data.

```typescript
@Controller()
@UseInterceptors(CacheInterceptor)
export class AppController {
  @Get()
  findAll(): string[] {
    return [];
  }
}
```

> warning**Warning** Only `GET` endpoints are cached. Also, HTTP server routes that inject the native response object (`@Res()`) cannot use the Cache Interceptor. See
> <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/interceptors#response-mapping">response mapping</a> for more details.

#### Global cache

To reduce the amount of required boilerplate, you can bind `CacheInterceptor` to all endpoints globally:

```typescript
import { CacheModule, Module, CacheInterceptor } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { APP_INTERCEPTOR } from '@nestjs/core';

@Module({
  imports: [CacheModule.register()],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [
    {
      provide: APP_INTERCEPTOR,
      useClass: CacheInterceptor,
    },
  ],
})
export class ApplicationModule {}
```

#### Customize caching

All cached data has its own expiration time (TTL). To customize default values, pass the options object to the `register()` method.

```typescript
CacheModule.register({
  ttl: 5, // seconds
  max: 10, // maximum number of items in cache
});
```

#### Global cache overrides

While global cache is enabled, cache entries are stored under a `CacheKey` that is auto-generated based on the route path. You may override certain cache settings (`@CacheKey()` and `@CacheTTL()`) on a per-method basis, allowing customized caching strategies for individual controller methods. This may be most relevant while using [different cache stores.](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#different-stores)

```typescript
@Controller()
export class AppController {
  @CacheKey('custom_key')
  @CacheTTL(20)
  findAll(): string[] {
    return [];
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** The `@CacheKey()` and `@CacheTTL()` decorators are imported from the `@nestjs/common` package.

The `@CacheKey()` decorator may be used with or without a corresponding `@CacheTTL()` decorator and vice versa. One may choose to override only the `@CacheKey()` or only the `@CacheTTL()`. Settings that are not overridden with a decorator will use the default values as registered globally (see [Customize caching](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/caching#customize-caching)).

#### WebSockets and Microservices

You can also apply the `CacheInterceptor` to WebSocket subscribers as well as Microservice's patterns (regardless of the transport method that is being used).

```typescript
@@filename()
@CacheKey('events')
@UseInterceptors(CacheInterceptor)
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(client: Client, data: string[]): Observable<string[]> {
  return [];
}
@@switch
@CacheKey('events')
@UseInterceptors(CacheInterceptor)
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(client, data) {
  return [];
}
```

However, the additional `@CacheKey()` decorator is required in order to specify a key used to subsequently store and retrieve cached data. Also, please note that you **shouldn't cache everything**. Actions which perform some business operations rather than simply querying the data should never be cached.

Additionally, you may specify a cache expiration time (TTL) by using the `@CacheTTL()` decorator, which will override the global default TTL value.

```typescript
@@filename()
@CacheTTL(10)
@UseInterceptors(CacheInterceptor)
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(client: Client, data: string[]): Observable<string[]> {
  return [];
}
@@switch
@CacheTTL(10)
@UseInterceptors(CacheInterceptor)
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(client, data) {
  return [];
}
```

> info **Hint** The `@CacheTTL()` decorator may be used with or without a corresponding `@CacheKey()` decorator.

#### Different stores

This service takes advantage of [cache-manager](https://github.com/BryanDonovan/node-cache-manager) under the hood. The `cache-manager` package supports a wide-range of useful stores, for example, [Redis](https://github.com/dabroek/node-cache-manager-redis-store) store. A full list of supported stores is available [here](https://github.com/BryanDonovan/node-cache-manager#store-engines). To set up the Redis store, simply pass the package together with corresponding options to the `register()` method.

```typescript
import * as redisStore from 'cache-manager-redis-store';
import { CacheModule, Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';

@Module({
  imports: [
    CacheModule.register({
      store: redisStore,
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 6379,
    }),
  ],
  controllers: [AppController],
})
export class ApplicationModule {}
```

#### Adjust tracking

By default, Nest uses the request URL (in an HTTP app) or cache key (in websockets and microservices apps, set through the `@CacheKey()` decorator) to associate cache records with your endpoints. Nevertheless, sometimes you might want to set up tracking based on different factors, for example, using HTTP headers (e.g. `Authorization` to properly identify `profile` endpoints).

In order to accomplish that, create a subclass of `CacheInterceptor` and override the `trackBy()` method.

```typescript
@Injectable()
class HttpCacheInterceptor extends CacheInterceptor {
  trackBy(context: ExecutionContext): string | undefined {
    return 'key';
  }
}
```

#### Async configuration

You may want to asynchronously pass in module options instead of passing them statically at compile time. In this case, use the `registerAsync()` method, which provides several ways to deal with async configuration.

One approach is to use a factory function:

```typescript
CacheModule.registerAsync({
  useFactory: () => ({
    ttl: 5,
  }),
});
```

Our factory behaves like all other asynchronous module factories (it can be `async` and is able to inject dependencies through `inject`).

```typescript
CacheModule.registerAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useFactory: async (configService: ConfigService) => ({
    ttl: configService.getString('CACHE_TTL'),
  }),
  inject: [ConfigService],
});
```

Alternatively, you can use the `useClass` method:

```typescript
CacheModule.registerAsync({
  useClass: CacheConfigService,
});
```

The above construction will instantiate `CacheConfigService` inside `CacheModule` and will use it to get the options object. The `CacheConfigService` has to implement the `CacheOptionsFactory` interface in order to provide the configuration options:

```typescript
@Injectable()
class CacheConfigService implements CacheOptionsFactory {
  createCacheOptions(): CacheModuleOptions {
    return {
      ttl: 5,
    };
  }
}
```

If you wish to use an existing configuration provider imported from a different module, use the `useExisting` syntax:

```typescript
CacheModule.registerAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useExisting: ConfigService,
});
```

This works the same as `useClass` with one critical difference - `CacheModule` will lookup imported modules to reuse any already-created `ConfigService`, instead of instantiating its own.
### Serialization <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/serialization"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="serialization" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Serialization is a process that happens before objects are returned in a network response. This is an appropriate place to provide rules for transforming and sanitizing the data to be returned to the client. For example, sensitive data like passwords should always be excluded from the response. Or, certain properties might require additional transformation, such as sending only a subset of properties of an entity. Performing these transformations manually can be tedious and error prone, and can leave you uncertain that all cases have been covered.

#### Overview

Nest provides a built-in capability to help ensure that these operations can be performed in a straightforward way. The `ClassSerializerInterceptor` interceptor uses the powerful [class-transformer](https://github.com/typestack/class-transformer) package to provide a declarative and extensible way of transforming objects. The basic operation it performs is to take the value returned by a method handler and apply the `classToPlain()` function from [class-transformer](https://github.com/typestack/class-transformer). In doing so, it can apply rules expressed by `class-transformer` decorators on an entity/DTO class, as described below.

#### Exclude properties

Let's assume that we want to automatically exclude a `password` property from a user entity. We annotate the entity as follows:

```typescript
import { Exclude } from 'class-transformer';

export class UserEntity {
  id: number;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;

  @Exclude()
  password: string;

  constructor(partial: Partial<UserEntity>) {
    Object.assign(this, partial);
  }
}
```

Now consider a controller with a method handler that returns an instance of this class.

```typescript
@UseInterceptors(ClassSerializerInterceptor)
@Get()
findOne(): UserEntity {
  return new UserEntity({
    id: 1,
    firstName: 'Kamil',
    lastName: 'Mysliwiec',
    password: 'password',
  });
}
```

> **Warning** Note that we must return an instance of the class. If you return a plain JavaScript object, for example, `{{ '{' }} user: new UserEntity() {{ '}' }}`, the object won't be properly serialized.

> info **Hint** The `ClassSerializerInterceptor` is imported from `@nestjs/common`.

When this endpoint is requested, the client receives the following response:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "firstName": "Kamil",
  "lastName": "Mysliwiec"
}
```

Note that the interceptor can be applied application-wide (as covered [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/interceptors#binding-interceptors)). The combination of the interceptor and the entity class declaration ensures that **any** method that returns a `UserEntity` will be sure to remove the `password` property. This gives you a measure of centralized enforcement of this business rule.

#### Expose properties

You can use the `@Expose()` decorator to provide alias names for properties, or to execute a function to calculate a property value (analogous to **getter** functions), as shown below.

```typescript
@Expose()
get fullName(): string {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
}
```

#### Transform

You can perform additional data transformation using the `@Transform()` decorator. For example, the following construct returns the name property of the `RoleEntity` instead of returning the whole object.

```typescript
@Transform(role => role.name)
role: RoleEntity;
```

#### Pass options

You may want to modify the default behavior of the transformation functions. To override default settings, pass them in an `options` object with the `@SerializeOptions()` decorator.

```typescript
@SerializeOptions({
  excludePrefixes: ['_'],
})
@Get()
findOne(): UserEntity {
  return new UserEntity();
}
```

> info **Hint** The `@SerializeOptions()` decorator is imported from `@nestjs/common`.

Options passed via `@SerializeOptions()` are passed as the second argument of the underlying `classToPlain()` function. In this example, we are automatically excluding all properties that begin with the `_` prefix.

#### WebSockets and Microservices

While this chapter shows examples using HTTP style applications (e.g., Express or Fastify), the `ClassSerializerInterceptor` works the same for WebSockets and Microservices, regardless of the transport method that is used.

### Task Scheduling <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/task-scheduling"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="task-scheduling" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Task scheduling allows you to schedule arbitrary code (methods/functions) to execute at a fixed date/time, at recurring intervals, or once after a specified interval. In the Linux world, this is often handled by packages like [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) at the OS level. For Node.js apps, there are several packages that emulate cron-like functionality. Nest provides the `@nestjs/schedule` package, which integrates with the popular Node.js [node-cron](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-cron) package. We'll cover this package in the current chapter.

#### Installation

To begin using it, we first install the required dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install --save @nestjs/schedule
```

To activate job scheduling, import the `ScheduleModule` into the root `AppModule` and run the `forRoot()` static method as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ScheduleModule } from '@nestjs/schedule';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ScheduleModule.forRoot()
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The `.forRoot()` call initializes the scheduler and registers any declarative <a href="techniques/task-scheduling#declarative-cron-jobs">cron jobs</a>, <a href="techniques/task-scheduling#declarative-timeouts">timeouts</a> and <a href="techniques/task-scheduling#declarative-intervals">intervals</a> that exist within your app. Registration occurs when the `onApplicationBootstrap` lifecycle hook occurs, ensuring that all modules have loaded and declared any scheduled jobs.

#### Declarative cron jobs

A cron job schedules an arbitrary function (method call) to run automatically. Cron jobs can run:

- Once, at a specified date/time.
- On a recurring basis; recurring jobs can run at a specified instant within a specified interval (for example, once per hour, once per week, once every 5 minutes)

Declare a cron job with the `@Cron()` decorator preceding the method definition containing the code to be executed, as follows:

```typescript
import { Injectable, Logger } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Cron } from '@nestjs/schedule';

@Injectable()
export class TasksService {
  private readonly logger = new Logger(TasksService.name);

  @Cron('45 * * * * *')
  handleCron() {
    this.logger.debug('Called when the current second is 45');
  }
}
```

In this example, the `handleCron()` method will be called each time the current second is `45`. In other words, the method will be run once per minute, at the 45 second mark.

The `@Cron()` decorator supports all standard [cron patterns](http://crontab.org/):

- Asterisk (e.g. `*`)
- Ranges (e.g. `1-3,5`)
- Steps (e.g. `*/2`)

In the example above, we passed `45 * * * * *` to the decorator. The following key shows how each position in the cron pattern string is interpreted:

<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">
* * * * * *
| | | | | |
| | | | | day of week
| | | | month
| | | day of month
| | hour
| minute
second (optional)
</code></pre>

Some sample cron patterns are:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>* * * * * *</code></td>
      <td>every second</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>45 * * * * *</code></td>
      <td>every minute, on the 45th second</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>* 10 * * * *</code></td>
      <td>every hour, at the start of the 10th minute</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>0 */30 9-17 * * *</code></td>
      <td>every 30 minutes between 9am and 5pm</td>
    </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><code>0 30 11 * * 1-5</code></td>
      <td>Monday to Friday at 11:30am</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The `@nestjs/schedule` package provides a convenience enum with commonly used cron patterns. You can use this enum as follows:

```typescript
import { Injectable, Logger } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Cron, CronExpression } from '@nestjs/schedule';

@Injectable()
export class TasksService {
  private readonly logger = new Logger(TasksService.name);

  @Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_45_SECONDS)
  handleCron() {
    this.logger.debug('Called every 45 seconds');
  }
}
```

In this example, the `handleCron()` method will be called every `45` seconds.

Alternatively, you can supply a JavaScript `Date` object to the `@Cron()` decorator. Doing so causes the job to execute exactly once, at the specified date.

> info **Hint** Use JavaScript date arithmetic to schedule jobs relative to the current date. For example, `@Cron(new Date(Date.now() + 10 * 1000))` to schedule a job to run 10 seconds after the app starts.

You can access and control a cron job after it's been declared, or dynamically create a cron job (where its cron pattern is defined at runtime) with the <a href="/techniques/task-scheduling#dynamic-schedule-module-api">Dynamic API</a>. To access a declarative cron job via the API, you must associate the job with a name by passing the `name` property in an optional options object as the second argument of the decorator, as shown below:

```typescript
@Cron('* * 8 * * *', {
  name: 'notifications',
})
triggerNotifications() {}
```

#### Declarative intervals

To declare that a method should run at a (recurring) specified interval, prefix the method definition with the `@Interval()` decorator. Pass the interval value, as a number in milliseconds, to the decorator as shown below:

```typescript
@Interval(10000)
handleInterval() {
  this.logger.debug('Called every 10 seconds');
}
```

> info **Hint** This mechanism uses the JavaScript `setInterval()` function under the hood. You can also utilize a cron job to schedule recurring jobs.

If you want to control your declarative interval from outside the declaring class via the <a href="/techniques/task-scheduling#dynamic-schedule-module-api">Dynamic API</a>, associate the interval with a name using the following construction:

```typescript
@Interval('notifications', 2500)
handleInterval() {}
```

The <a href="techniques/task-scheduling#dynamic-intervals">Dynamic API</a> also enables **creating** dynamic intervals, where the interval's properties are defined at runtime, and **listing and deleting** them.

<app-banner-enterprise></app-banner-enterprise>

#### Declarative timeouts

To declare that a method should run (once) at a specified timeout, prefix the method definition with the `@Timeout()` decorator. Pass the relative time offset (in milliseconds), from application startup, to the decorator as shown below:

```typescript
@Timeout(5000)
handleTimeout() {
  this.logger.debug('Called once after 5 seconds');
}
```

> info **Hint** This mechanism uses the JavaScript `setTimeout()` function under the hood.

If you want to control your declarative timeout from outside the declaring class via the <a href="/techniques/task-scheduling#dynamic-schedule-module-api">Dynamic API</a>, associate the timeout with a name using the following construction:

```typescript
@Timeout('notifications', 2500)
handleTimeout() {}
```

The <a href="techniques/task-scheduling#dynamic-timeouts">Dynamic API</a> also enables **creating** dynamic timeouts, where the timeout's properties are defined at runtime, and **listing and deleting** them.

#### Dynamic schedule module API

The `@nestjs/schedule` module provides a dynamic API that enables managing declarative <a href="techniques/task-scheduling#declarative-cron-jobs">cron jobs</a>, <a href="techniques/task-scheduling#declarative-timeouts">timeouts</a> and <a href="techniques/task-scheduling#declarative-intervals">intervals</a>. The API also enables creating and managing **dynamic** cron jobs, timeouts and intervals, where the properties are defined at runtime.

#### Dynamic cron jobs

Obtain a reference to a `CronJob` instance by name from anywhere in your code using the `SchedulerRegistry` API. First, inject `SchedulerRegistry` using standard constructor injection:

```typescript
constructor(private schedulerRegistry: SchedulerRegistry) {}
```

> info **Hint** Import the `SchedulerRegistry` from the `@nestjs/schedule` package.

Then use it in a class as follows. Assume a cron job was created with the following declaration:

```typescript
@Cron('* * 8 * * *', {
  name: 'notifications',
})
triggerNotifications() {}
```

Access this job using the following:

```typescript
const job = this.schedulerRegistry.getCronJob('notifications');

job.stop();
console.log(job.lastDate());
```

The `getCronJob()` method returns the named cron job. The returned `CronJob` object has the following methods:

- `stop()` - stops a job that is scheduled to run.
- `start()` - restarts a job that has been stopped.
- `setTime(time: CronTime)` - stops a job, sets a new time for it, and then starts it
- `lastDate()` - returns a string representation of the last date a job executed
- `nextDates(count: number)` - returns an array (size `count`) of `moment` objects representing upcoming job execution dates.

> info **Hint** Use `toDate()` on `moment` objects to render them in human readable form.

**Create** a new cron job dynamically using the `SchedulerRegistry.addCronJob()` method, as follows:

```typescript
addCronJob(name: string, seconds: string) {
  const job = new CronJob(`${seconds} * * * * *`, () => {
    this.logger.warn(`time (${seconds}) for job ${name} to run!`);
  });

  this.scheduler.addCronJob(name, job);
  job.start();

  this.logger.warn(
    `job ${name} added for each minute at ${seconds} seconds!`,
  );
}
```

In this code, we use the `CronJob` object from the `cron` package to create the cron job. The `CronJob` constructor takes a cron pattern (just like the `@Cron()` <a href="techniques/task-scheduling#declarative-cron-jobs">decorator</a>) as its first argument, and a callback to be executed when the cron timer fires as its second argument. The `SchedulerRegistry.addCronJob()` method takes two arguments: a name for the `CronJob`, and the `CronJob` object itself.

> warning **Warning** Remember to inject the `SchedulerRegistry` before accessing it. Import `CronJob` from the `cron` package.

**Delete** a named cron job using the `SchedulerRegistry.deleteCronJob()` method, as follows:

```typescript
deleteCron(name: string) {
  this.scheduler.deleteCronJob(name);
  this.logger.warn(`job ${name} deleted!`);
}
```

**List** all cron jobs using the `SchedulerRegistry.getCronJobs()` method as follows:

```typescript
getCrons() {
  const jobs = this.scheduler.getCronJobs();
  jobs.forEach((value, key, map) => {
    let next;
    try {
      next = value.nextDates().toDate();
    } catch (e) {
      next = 'error: next fire date is in the past!';
    }
    this.logger.log(`job: ${key} -> next: ${next}`);
  });
}
```

The `getCronJobs()` method returns a `map`. In this code, we iterate over the map and attempt to access the `nextDates()` method of each `CronJob`. In the `CronJob` API, if a job has already fired and has no future firing dates, it throws an exception.

#### Dynamic intervals

Obtain a reference to an interval with the `SchedulerRegistry.getInterval()` method. As above, inject `SchedulerRegistry` using standard constructor injection:

```typescript
constructor(private schedulerRegistry: SchedulerRegistry) {}
```

And use it as follows:

```typescript
const interval = this.schedulerRegistry.getInterval('notifications');
clearInterval(interval);
```

**Create** a new interval dynamically using the `SchedulerRegistry.addInterval()` method, as follows:

```typescript
addInterval(name: string, seconds: string) {
  const callback = () => {
    this.logger.warn(`Interval ${name} executing at time (${seconds})!`);
  };

  const interval = setInterval(callback, seconds);
  this.scheduler.addInterval(name, interval);
}
```

In this code, we create a standard JavaScript interval, then pass it to the `ScheduleRegistry.addInterval()` method.
That method takes two arguments: a name for the interval, and the interval itself.

**Delete** a named interval using the `SchedulerRegistry.deleteInterval()` method, as follows:

```typescript
deleteInterval(name: string) {
  this.scheduler.deleteInterval(name);
  this.logger.warn(`Interval ${name} deleted!`);
}
```

**List** all intervals using the `SchedulerRegistry.getIntervals()` method as follows:

```typescript
getIntervals() {
  const intervals = this.scheduler.getIntervals();
  intervals.forEach(key => this.logger.log(`Interval: ${key}`));
}
```

#### Dynamic timeouts

Obtain a reference to a timeout with the `SchedulerRegistry.getTimeout()` method. As above, inject `SchedulerRegistry` using standard constructor injection:

```typescript
constructor(private schedulerRegistry: SchedulerRegistry) {}
```

And use it as follows:

```typescript
const timeout = this.schedulerRegistry.getTimeout('notifications');
clearTimeout(timeout);
```

**Create** a new timeout dynamically using the `SchedulerRegistry.addTimeout()` method, as follows:

```typescript
addTimeout(name: string, seconds: string) {
  const callback = () => {
    this.logger.warn(`Timeout ${name} executing after (${seconds})!`);
  };

  const timeout = setTimeout(callback, seconds);
  this.scheduler.addTimeout(name, timeout);
}
```

In this code, we create a standard JavaScript timeout, then pass it to the `ScheduleRegistry.addTimeout()` method.
That method takes two arguments: a name for the timeout, and the timeout itself.

**Delete** a named timeout using the `SchedulerRegistry.deleteTimeout()` method, as follows:

```typescript
deleteTimeout(name: string) {
  this.scheduler.deleteTimeout(name);
  this.logger.warn(`Timeout ${name} deleted!`);
}
```

**List** all timeouts using the `SchedulerRegistry.getTimeouts()` method as follows:

```typescript
getTimeouts() {
  const timeouts = this.scheduler.getTimeouts();
  timeouts.forEach(key => this.logger.log(`Timeout: ${key}`));
}
```

#### Example

A working example is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/27-scheduling).
### Compression <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/compression"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="compression" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Compression can greatly decrease the size of the response body, thereby increasing the speed of a web app.

For **high-traffic** websites in production, it is strongly recommended to offload compression from the application server - typically in a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx). In that case, you should not use compression middleware.

#### Use with Express (default)

Use the [compression](https://github.com/expressjs/compression) middleware package to enable gzip compression.

First install the required package:

```bash
$ npm i --save compression
```

Once the installation is complete, apply the compression middleware as global middleware.

```typescript
import * as compression from 'compression';
// somewhere in your initialization file
app.use(compression());
```

#### Use with Fastify

If using the `FastifyAdapter`, you'll want to use [fastify-compress](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-compress):

```bash
$ npm i --save fastify-compress
```

Once the installation is complete, apply the fastify-compress middleware as global middleware.

```typescript
import * as compression from 'fastify-compress';
// somewhere in your initialization file
app.register(compression);
```

By default, fastify-compress will use Brotli compression (on Node >= 11.7.0) when browsers indicate support for the encoding. While Brotli is quite efficient in terms of compression ratio, it's also quite slow. Due to this, you may want to tell fastify-compress to only use deflate and gzip to compress responses; you'll end up with larger responses but they'll be delivered much more quickly.

To specify encodings, provide a second argument to `app.register`:

```typescript
app.register(compression, { encodings: ['gzip', 'deflate'] });
```

The above tells `fastify-compress` to only use gzip and deflate encodings, preferring gzip if the client supports both.
### Security <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/security"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="security-tk" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

In this chapter we cover various techniques that help you to increase the security of your applications.

#### Helmet

[Helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) can help protect your app from some well-known web vulnerabilities by setting HTTP headers appropriately. Generally, Helmet is just a collection of 14 smaller middleware functions that set security-related HTTP headers (read [more](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet#how-it-works)).

Start by installing the required package. If you are using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (default in Nest):

```bash
$ npm i --save helmet
```

Once the installation is complete, apply it as a global middleware.

```typescript
import * as helmet from 'helmet';
// somewhere in your initialization file
app.use(helmet());
```

If you are using the `FastifyAdapter`, you'll need [fastify-helmet](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-helmet) instead:

```bash
$ npm i --save fastify-helmet
```

[fastify-helmet](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-helmet) should not be used as a middleware, but as a [Fastify plugin](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Plugins/), i.e., by using `app.register()`:

```typescript
import * as helmet from 'fastify-helmet';
// somewhere in your initialization file
app.register(helmet);
// or the following, but note that it's not type safe
// app.getHttpAdapter().register(helmet);
```

> info **Hint** Note that applying `helmet` as global or registering it must come before other calls to `app.use()` or setup functions that may call `app.use()`). This is due to the way the underlying platform (i.e., Express or Fastify) works, where the order that middleware/routes are defined matters. If you use middleware like `helmet` or `cors` after you define a route, then that middleware will not apply to that route, it will only apply to middleware defined after the route.

#### CORS

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows resources to be requested from another domain. Under the hood, Nest makes use of the Express [cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) package. This package provides various options that you can customize based on your requirements. To enable CORS, call the `enableCors()` method on the Nest application object.

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
app.enableCors();
await app.listen(3000);
```

The `enableCors()` method takes an optional configuration object argument. The available properties of this object are described in the official [CORS](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#configuration-options) documentation.

Alternatively, enable CORS via the `create()` method's options object. Set the `cors` property to `true` to enable CORS with default settings. Alternatively, pass a [CORS configuration object](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#configuration-options) as the `cors` property value to customize its behavior.

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule, { cors: true });
await app.listen(3000);
```

#### CSRF

Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF or XSRF) is a type of malicious exploit of a website where **unauthorized** commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts. To mitigate this kind of attack you can use the [csurf](https://github.com/expressjs/csurf) package.

Start by installing the required package:

```bash
$ npm i --save csurf
```

> warning **Warning** As explained on the [csurf middleware page](https://github.com/expressjs/csurf#csurf), the csurf module requires either session middleware or a cookie-parser to be initialized first. Please see that documentation for further instructions.

Once the installation is complete, apply the csurf middleware as global middleware.

```typescript
import * as csurf from 'csurf';
// somewhere in your initialization file
app.use(csurf());
```

#### Rate limiting

A common technique to protect applications from brute-force attacks is **rate-limiting**. Many Express packages exist to provide a rate-limiting feature. A popular one is [express-rate-limit](https://github.com/nfriedly/express-rate-limit).

Start by installing the required package:

```bash
$ npm i --save express-rate-limit
```

Once the installation is complete, apply the rate-limiter as global middleware.

```typescript
import * as rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';
// somewhere in your initialization file
app.use(
  rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  }),
);
```

When there is a load balancer or reverse proxy between the server and the internet, Express may need to be configured to trust the headers set by the proxy in order to get the correct IP for the end user. To do so, first use the `NestExpressApplication` platform [interface](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps#platform) when creating your `app` instance, then enable the [trust proxy](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/behind-proxies.html) setting:

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create<NestExpressApplication>(AppModule);
// see https://expressjs.com/en/guide/behind-proxies.html
app.set('trust proxy', 1);
```

> info **Hint** If you use the `FastifyAdapter`, consider using [fastify-rate-limit](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-rate-limit) instead.
### Queues <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/queues"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="queues" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Queues are a powerful design pattern that help you deal with common application scaling and performance challenges. Some examples of problems that Queues can help you solve are:

- Smooth out processing peaks. For example, if users can initiate resource-intensive tasks at arbitrary times, you can add these tasks to a queue instead of performing them synchronously. Then you can have worker processes pull tasks from the queue in a controlled manner. You can easily add new Queue consumers to scale up the back-end task handling as the application scales up.
- Break up monolithic tasks that may otherwise block the Node.js event loop. For example, if a user request requires CPU intensive work like audio transcoding, you can delegate this task to other processes, freeing up user-facing processes to remain responsive.
- Provide a reliable communication channel across various services. For example, you can queue tasks (jobs) in one process or service, and consume them in another. You can be notified (by listening for status events) upon completion, error or other state changes in the job life cycle from any process or service. When Queue producers or consumers fail, their state is preserved and task handling can restart automatically when nodes are restarted.

Nest provides the `@nestjs/bull` package as an abstraction/wrapper on top of [Bull](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull), a popular, well supported, high performance Node.js based Queue system implementation. The package makes it easy to integrate Bull Queues in a Nest-friendly way to your application.

Bull uses [Redis](https://redis.io/) to persist job data, so you'll need to have Redis installed on your system. Because it is Redis-backed, your Queue architecture can be completely distributed and platform-independent. For example, you can have some Queue <a href="techniques/queues#producers">producers</a> and <a href="techniques/queues#consumers">consumers</a> and <a href="techniques/queues#event-listeners">listeners</a> running in Nest on one (or several) nodes, and other producers, consumers and listeners running on other Node.js platforms on other network nodes.

This chapter covers the `@nestjs/bull` package. We also recommend reading the [Bull documentation](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/master/REFERENCE.md) for more background and specific implementation details.

#### Installation

To begin using it, we first install the required dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install --save @nestjs/bull bull
$ npm install --save-dev @types/bull
```

Once the installation process is complete, we can import the `BullModule` into the root `AppModule`.

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { BullModule } from '@nestjs/bull';

@Module({
  imports: [
    BullModule.registerQueue({
      name: 'audio',
      redis: {
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 6379,
      },
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The `registerQueue()` method is used to instantiate and/or register queues. Queues are shared across modules and processes that connect to the same underlying Redis database with the same credentials. Each queue is unique by its name property (see below). When sharing queues (across modules/processes), the first `registerQueue()` method to run both **instantiates** the queue and **registers** it for that module. Other modules (in the same or separate processes) simply **register** the queue. Queue registration creates an **injection token** that can be used to access the queue in a given Nest module.

For each queue, pass a configuration object containing the following properties:

- `name: string` - A queue name, which will be used as both an injection token (for injecting the queue into controllers/providers), and as an argument to decorators to associate consumer classes and listeners with queues. Required.
- `limiter: RateLimiter` - Options to control the rate at which the queue's jobs are processed. See [RateLimiter](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/master/REFERENCE.md#queue) for more information. Optional.
- `redis: RedisOpts` - Options to configure the Redis connection. See [RedisOpts](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/master/REFERENCE.md#queue) for more information. Optional.
- `prefix: string` - Prefix for all queue keys. Optional.
- `defaultJobOptions: JobOpts` - Options to control the default settings for new jobs. See [JobOpts](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/master/REFERENCE.md#queueadd) for more information. Optional.
- `settings: AdvancedSettings` - Advanced Queue configuration settings. These should usually not be changed. See [AdvancedSettings](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/master/REFERENCE.md#queue) for more information. Optional.

As noted, the `name` property is required. The rest of the options are optional, providing detailed control over queue behavior. These are passed directly to the Bull `Queue` constructor. Read more about these options [here](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/master/REFERENCE.md#queue). When registering a queue in a second or subsequent module, it is best practice to omit all options but the `name` property from the configuration object. These options should be specified only in the module that **instantiates** the queue.

> info **Hint** Create multiple queues by passing multiple comma-separated configuration objects to the `registerQueue()` method.

Since jobs are persisted in Redis, each time a specific named queue is instantiated (e.g., when an app is started/restarted), it attempts to process any old jobs that may exist from a previous unfinished session.

Each queue can have one or many producers, consumers, and listeners. Consumers retrieve jobs from the queue in a specific order: FIFO (the default), LIFO, or according to priorities. Controlling queue processing order is discussed <a href="techniques/queues#consumers">here</a>.

<app-banner-enterprise></app-banner-enterprise>

#### Producers

Job producers add jobs to queues. Producers are typically application services (Nest [providers](/providers)). To add jobs to a queue, first inject the queue into the service as follows:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Queue } from 'bull';
import { InjectQueue } from '@nestjs/bull';

@Injectable()
export class AudioService {
  constructor(@InjectQueue('audio') private audioQueue: Queue) {}
}
```

> info **Hint** The `@InjectQueue()` decorator identifies the queue by its name, as provided in the `registerQueue()` method call (e.g., `'audio'`).

Now, add a job by calling the queue's `add()` method, passing a user-defined job object. Jobs are represented as serializable JavaScript objects (since that is how they are stored in the Redis database). The shape of the job you pass is arbitrary; use it to represent the semantics of your job object.

```typescript
const job = await this.audioQueue.add({
  foo: 'bar',
});
```

#### Named jobs

Jobs may have unique names. This allows you to create specialized <a href="techniques/queues#consumers">consumers</a> that will only process jobs with a given name.

```typescript
const job = await this.audioQueue.add('transcode', {
  foo: 'bar',
});
```

> Warning **Warning** When using named jobs, you must create processors for each unique name added to a queue, or the queue will complain that you are missing a processor for the given job. See <a href="techniques/queues#consumers">here</a> for more information on consuming named jobs.

#### Job options

Jobs can have additional options associated with them. Pass an options object after the `job` argument in the `Queue.add()` method. Job options properties are:

- `priority`: `number` - Optional priority value. Ranges from 1 (highest priority) to MAX_INT (lowest priority). Note that using priorities has a slight impact on performance, so use them with caution.
- `delay`: `number` - An amount of time (milliseconds) to wait until this job can be processed. Note that for accurate delays, both server and clients should have their clocks synchronized.
- `attempts`: `number` - The total number of attempts to try the job until it completes.
- `repeat`: `RepeatOpts` - Repeat job according to a cron specification. See [RepeatOpts](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/master/REFERENCE.md#queueadd).
- `backoff`: `number | BackoffOpts` - Backoff setting for automatic retries if the job fails. See [BackoffOpts](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/master/REFERENCE.md#queueadd).
- `lifo`: `boolean` - If true, adds the job to the right end of the queue instead of the left (default false).
- `timeout`: `number` - The number of milliseconds after which the job should fail with a timeout error.
- `jobId`: `number` | `string` - Override the job ID - by default, the job ID is a unique
  integer, but you can use this setting to override it. If you use this option, it is up to you to ensure the jobId is unique. If you attempt to add a job with an id that already exists, it will not be added.
- `removeOnComplete`: `boolean | number` - If true, removes the job when it successfully completes. A number specifies the amount of jobs to keep. Default behavior is to keep the job in the completed set.
- `removeOnFail`: `boolean | number` - If true, removes the job when it fails after all attempts. A number specifies the amount of jobs to keep. Default behavior is to keep the job in the failed set.
- `stackTraceLimit`: `number` - Limits the amount of stack trace lines that will be recorded in the stacktrace.

Here are a few examples of customizing jobs with job options.

To delay the start of a job, use the `delay` configuration property.

```typescript
const job = await this.audioQueue.add(
  {
    foo: 'bar',
  },
  { delay: 3000 }, // 3 seconds delayed
);
```

To add a job to the right end of the queue (process the job as **LIFO** (Last In First Out)), set the `lifo` property of the configuration object to `true`.

```typescript
const job = await this.audioQueue.add(
  {
    foo: 'bar',
  },
  { lifo: true },
);
```

To prioritize a job, use the `priority` property.

```typescript
const job = await this.audioQueue.add(
  {
    foo: 'bar',
  },
  { priority: 2 },
);
```

#### Consumers

A consumer is a **class** defining methods that either process jobs added into the queue, or listen for events on the queue, or both. Declare a consumer class using the `@Processor()` decorator as follows:

```typescript
import { Processor } from '@nestjs/bull';

@Processor('audio')
export class AudioConsumer {}
```

Where the decorator's string argument (e.g., `'audio'`) is the name of the queue to be associated with the class methods.

Within a consumer class, declare job handlers by decorating handler methods with the `@Process()` decorator.

```typescript
import { Processor, Process } from '@nestjs/bull';
import { Job } from 'bull';

@Processor('audio')
export class AudioConsumer {
  @Process()
  async transcode(job: Job<unknown>) {
    let progress = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      await doSomething(job.data);
      progress += 10;
      job.progress(progress);
    }
    return {};
  }
}
```

The decorated method (e.g., `transcode()`) is called whenever the worker is idle and there are jobs to process in the queue. This handler method receives the `job` object as its only argument. The value returned by the handler method is stored in the job object and can be accessed later on, for example in a listener for the completed event.

`Job` objects have multiple methods that allow you to interact with their state. For example, the above code uses the `progress()` method to update the job's progress. See [here](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/master/REFERENCE.md#job) for the complete `Job` object API reference.

You can designate that a job handler method will handle **only** jobs of a certain type (jobs with a specific `name`) by passing that `name` to the `@Process()` decorator as shown below. You can have multiple `@Process()` handlers in a given consumer class, corresponding to each job type (`name`). When you use named jobs, be sure to have a handler corresponding to each name.

```typescript
@Process('transcode')
async transcode(job: Job<unknown>) { ... }
```

#### Event listeners

Bull generates a set of useful events when queue and/or job state changes occur. Nest provides a set of decorators that allow subscribing to a core set of standard events. These are exported from the `@nestjs/bull` package.

Event listeners must be declared within a <a href="techniques/queues#consumers">consumer</a> class (i.e., within a class decorated with the `@Processor()` decorator). To listen for an event, use one of the decorators in the table below to declare a handler for the event. For example, to listen to the event emitted when a job enters the active state in the `audio` queue, use the following construct:

```typescript
import { Processor, Process } from '@nestjs/bull';
import { Job } from 'bull';

@Processor('audio')
export class AudioConsumer {

  @OnQueueActive()
  onActive(job: Job) {
    console.log(
      `Processing job ${job.id} of type ${job.name} with data ${job.data}...`,
    );
  }
  ...
```

Since Bull operates in a distributed (multi-node) environment, it defines the concept of event locality. This concept recognizes that events may be triggered either entirely within a single process, or on shared queues from different processes. A **local** event is one that is produced when an action or state change is triggered on a queue in the local process. In other words, when your event producers and consumers are local to a single process, all events happening on queues are local.

When a queue is shared across multiple processes, we encounter the possibility of **global** events. For a listener in one process to receive an event notification triggered by another process, it must register for a global event.

Event handlers are invoked whenever their corresponding event is emitted. The handler is called with the signature shown in the table below, providing access to information relevant to the event. We discuss one key difference between local and global event handler signatures below.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Local event listeners</th>
    <th>Global event listeners</th>
    <th>Handler method signature / When fired</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>@OnQueueError()</code></td><td><code>@OnGlobalQueueError()</code></td><td><code>handler(error: Error)</code> - An error occurred. <code>error</code> contains the triggering error.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>@OnQueueWaiting()</code></td><td><code>@OnGlobalQueueWaiting()</code></td><td><code>handler(jobId: number | string)</code> - A Job is waiting to be processed as soon as a worker is idling. <code>jobId</code> contains the id for the job that has entered this state.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>@OnQueueActive()</code></td><td><code>@OnGlobalQueueActive()</code></td><td><code>handler(job: Job)</code> - Job <code>job</code>has started. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>@OnQueueStalled()</code></td><td><code>@OnGlobalQueueStalled()</code></td><td><code>handler(job: Job)</code> - Job <code>job</code> has been marked as stalled. This is useful for debugging job workers that crash or pause the event loop.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>@OnQueueProgress()</code></td><td><code>@OnGlobalQueueProgress()</code></td><td><code>handler(job: Job, progress: number)</code> - Job <code>job</code>'s progress was updated to value <code>progress</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>@OnQueueCompleted()</code></td><td><code>@OnGlobalQueueCompleted()</code></td><td><code>handler(job: Job, result: any)</code> Job <code>job</code> successfully completed with a result <code>result</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>@OnQueueFailed()</code></td><td><code>@OnGlobalQueueFailed()</code></td><td><code>handler(job: Job, err: Error)</code> Job <code>job</code> failed with reason <code>err</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>@OnQueuePaused()</code></td><td><code>@OnGlobalQueuePaused()</code></td><td><code>handler()</code> The queue has been paused.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>@OnQueueResumed()</code></td><td><code>@OnGlobalQueueResumed()</code></td><td><code>handler(job: Job)</code> The queue has been resumed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>@OnQueueCleaned()</code></td><td><code>@OnGlobalQueueCleaned()</code></td><td><code>handler(jobs: Job[], type: string)</code> Old jobs have been cleaned from the queue. <code>jobs</code> is an array of cleaned jobs, and <code>type</code> is the type of jobs cleaned.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>@OnQueueDrained()</code></td><td><code>@OnGlobalQueueDrained()</code></td><td><code>handler()</code> Emitted whenever the queue has processed all the waiting jobs (even if there can be some delayed jobs not yet processed).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>@OnQueueRemoved()</code></td><td><code>@OnGlobalQueueRemoved()</code></td><td><code>handler(job: Job)</code> Job <code>job</code> was successfully removed.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

When listening for global events, the method signatures can be slightly different from their local counterpart. Specifically, any method signature that receives `job` objects in the local version, instead receives a `jobId` (`number`) in the global version. To get a reference to the actual `job` object in such a case, use the `Queue#getJob` method. This call should be awaited, and therefore the handler should be declared `async`. For example:

```typescript
@OnGlobalQueueCompleted()
async onGlobalCompleted(jobId: number, result: any) {
  const job = await this.immediateQueue.getJob(jobId);
  console.log('(Global) on completed: job ', job.id, ' -> result: ', result);
}
```

> info **Hint** To access the `Queue` object (to make a `getJob()` call), you must of course inject it. Also, the Queue must be registered in the module where you are injecting it.

In addition to the specific event listener decorators, you can also use the generic `@OnQueueEvent()` decorator in combination with either `BullQueueEvents` or `BullQueueGlobalEvents` enums. Read more about events [here](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/master/REFERENCE.md#events).

#### Queue management

Queue's have an API that allows you to perform management functions like pausing and resuming, retrieving the count of jobs in various states, and several more. You can find the full queue API [here](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/master/REFERENCE.md#queue). Invoke any of these methods directly on the `Queue` object, as shown below with the pause/resume examples.

Pause a queue with the `pause()` method call. A paused queue will not process new jobs until resumed, but current jobs being processed will continue until they are finalized.

```typescript
await audioQueue.pause();
```

To resume a paused queue, use the `resume()` method, as follows:

```typescript
await audioQueue.resume();
```

#### Async configuration

You may want to pass your queue options asynchronously instead of statically. In this case, use the `registerQueueAsync()` method, which provides several ways to deal with async configuration.

One approach is to use a factory function:

```typescript
BullModule.registerQueueAsync({
  name: 'audio',
  useFactory: () => ({
    redis: {
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 6379,
    },
  }),
});
```

Our factory behaves like any other [asynchronous provider](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/async-providers) (e.g., it can be `async` and it's able to inject dependencies through `inject`).

```typescript
BullModule.registerQueueAsync({
  name: 'audio',
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useFactory: async (configService: ConfigService) => ({
    redis: {
      host: configService.get('QUEUE_HOST'),
      port: +configService.get('QUEUE_PORT'),
    },
  }),
  inject: [ConfigService],
});
```

Alternatively, you can use the `useClass` syntax:

```typescript
BullModule.registerQueueAsync({
  name: 'audio',
  useClass: BullConfigService,
});
```

The construction above will instantiate `BullConfigService` inside `BullModule` and use it to provide an options object by calling `createBullOptions()`. Note that this means that the `BullConfigService` has to implement the `BullOptionsFactory` interface, as shown below:

```typescript
@Injectable()
class BullConfigService implements BullOptionsFactory {
  createBullOptions(): BullModuleOptions {
    return {
      redis: {
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 6379,
      },
    };
  }
}
```

In order to prevent the creation of `BullConfigService` inside `BullModule` and use a provider imported from a different module, you can use the `useExisting` syntax.

```typescript
BullModule.registerQueueAsync({
  name: 'audio',
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useExisting: ConfigService,
});
```

This construction works the same as `useClass` with one critical difference - `BullModule` will lookup imported modules to reuse an existing `ConfigService` instead of instantiating a new one.

#### Example

A working example is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/26-queues).
### Logger <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/logger"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="logger" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Nest comes with a built-in text-based logger which is used during application bootstrapping and several other circumstances such as displaying caught exceptions (i.e., system logging). This functionality is provided via the `Logger` class in the `@nestjs/common` package. You can fully control the behavior of the logging system, including any of the following:

- disable logging entirely
- specify the log level of detail (e.g., display errors, warnings, debug information, etc.)
- completely override the default logger
- customize the default logger by extending it
- make use of dependency injection to simplify composing and testing your application

You can also make use of the built-in logger, or create your own custom implementation, to log your own application-level events and messages.

For more advanced logging functionality, you can make use of any Node.js logging package, such as [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston), to implement a completely custom, production grade logging system.

#### Basic customization

To disable logging, set the `logger` property to `false` in the (optional) Nest application options object passed as the second argument to the `NestFactory.create()` method.

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule, {
  logger: false,
});
await app.listen(3000);
```

To enable specific logging levels, set the `logger` property to an array of strings specifying the log levels to display, as follows:

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule, {
  logger: ['error', 'warn'],
});
await app.listen(3000);
```

Values in the array can be any combination of `'log'`, `'error'`, `'warn'`, `'debug'`, and `'verbose'`.

#### Custom implementation

You can provide a custom logger implementation to be used by Nest for system logging by setting the value of the `logger` property to an object that fulfills the `LoggerService` interface. For example, you can tell Nest to use the built-in global JavaScript `console` object (which implements the `LoggerService` interface), as follows:

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule, {
  logger: console,
});
await app.listen(3000);
```

Implementing your own custom logger is straightforward. Simply implement each of the methods of the `LoggerService` interface as shown below.

```typescript
import { LoggerService } from '@nestjs/common';

export class MyLogger implements LoggerService {
  log(message: string) {
    /* your implementation */
  }
  error(message: string, trace: string) {
    /* your implementation */
  }
  warn(message: string) {
    /* your implementation */
  }
  debug(message: string) {
    /* your implementation */
  }
  verbose(message: string) {
    /* your implementation */
  }
}
```

You can then supply an instance of `MyLogger` via the `logger` property of the Nest application options object.

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule, {
  logger: new MyLogger(),
});
await app.listen(3000);
```

This technique, while simple, doesn't utilize dependency injection for the `MyLogger` class. This can pose some challenges, particularly for testing, and limit the reusability of `MyLogger`. For a better solution, see the <a href="techniques/logger#dependency-injection">Dependency Injection</a> section below.

#### Extend built-in logger

Rather than writing a logger from scratch, you may be able to meet your needs by extending the built-in `Logger` class and overriding selected behavior of the default implementation.

```typescript
import { Logger } from '@nestjs/common';

export class MyLogger extends Logger {
  error(message: string, trace: string) {
    // add your tailored logic here
    super.error(message, trace);
  }
}
```

You can use such an extended logger in your feature modules as described in the <a href="techniques/logger#using-the-logger-for-application-logging">Using the logger for application logging</a> section below.

You can tell Nest to use your extended logger for system logging by passing an instance of it via the `logger` property of the application options object (as shown in the <a href="techniques/logger#custom-logger-implementation">Custom implementation</a> section above), or by using the technique shown in the <a href="techniques/logger#dependency-injection">Dependency Injection</a> section below. If you do so, you should take care to call `super`, as shown in the sample code above, to delegate the specific log method call to the parent (built-in) class so that Nest can rely on the built-in features it expects.

<app-banner-courses></app-banner-courses>

#### Dependency injection

For more advanced logging functionality, you'll want to take advantage of dependency injection. For example, you may want to inject a `ConfigService` into your logger to customize it, and in turn inject your custom logger into other controllers and/or providers. To enable dependency injection for your custom logger, create a class that implements `LoggerService` and register that class as a provider in some module. For example, you can

1. Define a `MyLogger` class that either extends the built-in `Logger` or completely overrides it, as shown in previous sections.
2. Create a `LoggerModule` as shown below, and provide `MyLogger` from that module.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MyLogger } from './my-logger.service';

@Module({
  providers: [MyLogger],
  exports: [MyLogger],
})
export class LoggerModule {}
```

With this construct, you are now providing your custom logger for use by any other module. Because your `MyLogger` class is part of a module, it can use dependency injection (for example, to inject a `ConfigService`). There's one more technique needed to provide this custom logger for use by Nest for system logging (e.g., for bootstrapping and error handling).

Because application instantiation (`NestFactory.create()`) happens outside the context of any module, it doesn't participate in the normal Dependency Injection phase of initialization. So we must ensure that at least one application module imports the `LoggerModule` to trigger Nest to instantiate a singleton instance of our `MyLogger` class. We can then instruct Nest to use the same singleton instance of `MyLogger` with the following construction:

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule, {
  logger: false,
});
app.useLogger(app.get(MyLogger));
await app.listen(3000);
```

Here we use the `get()` method on the `NestApplication` instance to retrieve the singleton instance of the `MyLogger` object. This technique is essentially a way to "inject" an instance of a logger for use by Nest. The `app.get()` call retrieves the singleton instance of `MyLogger`, and depends on that instance being first injected in another module, as described above.

You can also inject this `MyLogger` provider in your feature classes, thus ensuring consistent logging behavior across both Nest system logging and application logging. See <a href="techniques/logger#using-the-logger-for-application-logging">Using the logger for application logging</a> below for more information.

The only downside of this solution is that your first initialization messages won't be handled by your logger instance, though, it shouldn't really matter at this point.

#### Using the logger for application logging

We can combine several of the techniques above to provide consistent behavior and formatting across both Nest system logging and our own application event/message logging. In this section, we'll achieve this with the following steps:

1. We extend the built-in logger and customize the `context` portion of the log message (e.g., the phrase `NestFactory` in square brackets in the log line shown below).

```bash
[Nest] 19096   - 12/08/2019, 7:12:59 AM   [NestFactory] Starting Nest application...
```

2. We inject a [transient](/fundamentals/injection-scopes) instance of the `Logger` into our feature modules so that each one has its own custom context.
3. We supply this extended logger for Nest to use for system logging.

To start, extend the built-in logger with code like the following. We supply the `scope` option as configuration metadata for the `Logger` class, specifying a [transient](/fundamentals/injection-scopes) scope, to ensure that we'll have a unique instance of the `Logger` in each feature module. In this example, we do not extend the individual `Logger` methods (like `log()`, `warn()`, etc.), though you may choose to do so.

```typescript
import { Injectable, Scope, Logger } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable({ scope: Scope.TRANSIENT })
export class MyLogger extends Logger {}
```

Next, create a `LoggerModule` with a construction like this:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MyLogger } from './my-logger.service';

@Module({
  providers: [MyLogger],
  exports: [MyLogger],
})
export class LoggerModule {}
```

Next, import the `LoggerModule` into your feature module. Then set the logger context, and start using the context-aware custom logger, like this:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MyLogger } from './my-logger.service';

@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  private readonly cats: Cat[] = [];

  constructor(private myLogger: MyLogger) {
    this.myLogger.setContext('CatsService');
  }

  findAll(): Cat[] {
    this.myLogger.warn('About to return cats!');
    return this.cats;
  }
}
```

Finally, instruct Nest to use an instance of the custom logger in your `main.ts` file as shown below. Of course in this example, we haven't actually customized the logger behavior (by extending the `Logger` methods like `log()`, `warn()`, etc.), so this step isn't actually needed. But it **would** be needed if you added custom logic to those methods and wanted Nest to use the same implementation.

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule, {
  logger: false,
});
app.useLogger(new MyLogger());
await app.listen(3000);
```

#### Use external logger

Production applications often have specific logging requirements, including advanced filtering, formatting and centralized logging. Nest's built-in logger is used for monitoring Nest system behavior, and can also be useful for basic formatted text logging in your feature modules while in development, but production applications often take advantage of dedicated logging modules like [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston). As with any standard Node.js application, you can take full advantage of such modules in Nest.
### File upload <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/file-upload"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="file-upload" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

To handle file uploading, Nest provides a built-in module based on the [multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) middleware package for Express. Multer handles data posted in the `multipart/form-data` format, which is primarily used for uploading files via an HTTP `POST` request. This module is fully configurable and you can adjust its behavior to your application requirements.

> warning **Warning** Multer cannot process data which is not in the supported multipart format (`multipart/form-data`). Also, note that this package is not compatible with the `FastifyAdapter`.

#### Basic example

To upload a single file, simply tie the `FileInterceptor()` interceptor to the route handler and extract `file` from the `request` using the `@UploadedFile()` decorator.

```typescript
@@filename()
@Post('upload')
@UseInterceptors(FileInterceptor('file'))
uploadFile(@UploadedFile() file) {
  console.log(file);
}
@@switch
@Post('upload')
@UseInterceptors(FileInterceptor('file'))
@Bind(UploadedFile())
uploadFile(file) {
  console.log(file);
}
```

> info **Hint** The `FileInterceptor()` decorator is exported from the `@nestjs/platform-express` package. The `@UploadedFile()` decorator is exported from `@nestjs/common`.

The `FileInterceptor()` decorator takes two arguments:

- `fieldName`: string that supplies the name of the field from the HTML form that holds a file
- `options`: optional object of type `MulterOptions`. This is the same object used by the multer constructor (more details [here](https://github.com/expressjs/multer#multeropts)).

#### Array of files

To upload an array of files (identified with a single field name), use the `FilesInterceptor()` decorator (note the plural **Files** in the decorator name). This decorator takes three arguments:

- `fieldName`: as described above
- `maxCount`: optional number defining the maximum number of files to accept
- `options`: optional `MulterOptions` object, as described above

When using `FilesInterceptor()`, extract files from the `request` with the `@UploadedFiles()` decorator.

```typescript
@@filename()
@Post('upload')
@UseInterceptors(FilesInterceptor('files'))
uploadFile(@UploadedFiles() files) {
  console.log(files);
}
@@switch
@Post('upload')
@UseInterceptors(FilesInterceptor('files'))
@Bind(UploadedFiles())
uploadFile(files) {
  console.log(files);
}
```

> info **Hint** The `FilesInterceptor()` decorator is exported from the `@nestjs/platform-express` package. The `@UploadedFiles()` decorator is exported from `@nestjs/common`.

#### Multiple files

To upload multiple fields (all with different field name keys), use the `FileFieldsInterceptor()` decorator. This decorator takes two arguments:

- `uploadedFields`: an array of objects, where each object specifies a required `name` property with a string value specifying a field name, as described above, and an optional `maxCount` property, as described above
- `options`: optional `MulterOptions` object, as described above

When using `FileFieldsInterceptor()`, extract files from the `request` with the `@UploadedFiles()` decorator.

```typescript
@@filename()
@Post('upload')
@UseInterceptors(FileFieldsInterceptor([
  { name: 'avatar', maxCount: 1 },
  { name: 'background', maxCount: 1 },
]))
uploadFile(@UploadedFiles() files) {
  console.log(files);
}
@@switch
@Post('upload')
@Bind(UploadedFiles())
@UseInterceptors(FileFieldsInterceptor([
  { name: 'avatar', maxCount: 1 },
  { name: 'background', maxCount: 1 },
]))
uploadFile(files) {
  console.log(files);
}
```

#### Any files

To upload all fields with arbitrary field name keys, use the `AnyFilesInterceptor()` decorator. This decorator can accept an optional `options` object as described above.

When using `AnyFilesInterceptor()`, extract files from the `request` with the `@UploadedFiles()` decorator.

```typescript
@@filename()
@Post('upload')
@UseInterceptors(AnyFilesInterceptor())
uploadFile(@UploadedFiles() files) {
  console.log(files);
}
@@switch
@Post('upload')
@Bind(UploadedFiles())
@UseInterceptors(AnyFilesInterceptor())
uploadFile(files) {
  console.log(files);
}
```

#### Default options

You can specify multer options in the file interceptors as described above. To set default options, you can call the static `register()` method when you import the `MulterModule`, passing in supported options. You can use all options listed [here](https://github.com/expressjs/multer#multeropts).

```typescript
MulterModule.register({
  dest: '/upload',
});
```

> info **Hint** The `MulterModule` class is exported from the `@nestjs/platform-express` package.

#### Async configuration

When you need to set `MulterModule` options asynchronously instead of statically, use the `registerAsync()` method. As with most dynamic modules, Nest provides several techniques to deal with async configuration.

One technique is to use a factory function:

```typescript
MulterModule.registerAsync({
  useFactory: () => ({
    dest: '/upload',
  }),
});
```

Like other [factory providers](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers#factory-providers-usefactory), our factory function can be `async` and can inject dependencies through `inject`.

```typescript
MulterModule.registerAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useFactory: async (configService: ConfigService) => ({
    dest: configService.getString('MULTER_DEST'),
  }),
  inject: [ConfigService],
});
```

Alternatively, you can configure the `MulterModule` using a class instead of a factory, as shown below:

```typescript
MulterModule.registerAsync({
  useClass: MulterConfigService,
});
```

The construction above instantiates `MulterConfigService` inside `MulterModule`, using it to create the required options object. Note that in this example, the `MulterConfigService` has to implement the `MulterOptionsFactory` interface, as shown below. The `MulterModule` will call the `createMulterOptions()` method on the instantiated object of the supplied class.

```typescript
@Injectable()
class MulterConfigService implements MulterOptionsFactory {
  createMulterOptions(): MulterModuleOptions {
    return {
      dest: '/upload',
    };
  }
}
```

If you want to reuse an existing options provider instead of creating a private copy inside the `MulterModule`, use the `useExisting` syntax.

```typescript
MulterModule.registerAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useExisting: ConfigService,
});
```
### HTTP module <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/http-module"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="http-module" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) is richly featured HTTP client package that is widely used. Nest wraps Axios and exposes it via the built-in `HttpModule`. The `HttpModule` exports the `HttpService` class, which exposes Axios-based methods to perform HTTP requests. The library also transforms the resulting HTTP responses into `Observables`.

To use the `HttpService`, first import `HttpModule`.

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [HttpModule],
  providers: [CatsService],
})
export class CatsModule {}
```

Next, inject `HttpService` using normal constructor injection.

> info **Hint** `HttpModule` and `HttpService` are imported from `@nestjs/common` package.

```typescript
@@filename()
@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  constructor(private httpService: HttpService) {}

  findAll(): Observable<AxiosResponse<Cat[]>> {
    return this.httpService.get('http://localhost:3000/cats');
  }
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
@Dependencies(HttpService)
export class CatsService {
  constructor(httpService) {
    this.httpService = httpService;
  }

  findAll() {
    return this.httpService.get('http://localhost:3000/cats');
  }
}
```

All `HttpService` methods return an `AxiosResponse` wrapped in an `Observable` object.

#### Configuration

[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) can be configured with a variety of options to customize the behavior of the `HttpService`. Read more about them [here](https://github.com/axios/axios#request-config). To configure the underlying Axios instance, pass an optional options object to the `register()` method of `HttpModule` when importing it. This options object will be passed directly to the underlying Axios constructor.

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [
    HttpModule.register({
      timeout: 5000,
      maxRedirects: 5,
    }),
  ],
  providers: [CatsService],
})
export class CatsModule {}
```

#### Async configuration

When you need to pass module options asynchronously instead of statically, use the `registerAsync()` method. As with most dynamic modules, Nest provides several techniques to deal with async configuration.

One technique is to use a factory function:

```typescript
HttpModule.registerAsync({
  useFactory: () => ({
    timeout: 5000,
    maxRedirects: 5,
  }),
});
```

Like other factory providers, our factory function can be [async](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers#factory-providers-usefactory) and can inject dependencies through `inject`.

```typescript
HttpModule.registerAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useFactory: async (configService: ConfigService) => ({
    timeout: configService.getString('HTTP_TIMEOUT'),
    maxRedirects: configService.getString('HTTP_MAX_REDIRECTS'),
  }),
  inject: [ConfigService],
});
```

Alternatively, you can configure the `HttpModule` using a class instead of a factory, as shown below.

```typescript
HttpModule.registerAsync({
  useClass: HttpConfigService,
});
```

The construction above instantiates `HttpConfigService` inside `HttpModule`, using it to create an options object. Note that in this example, the `HttpConfigService` has to implement `HttpModuleOptionsFactory` interface as shown below. The `HttpModule` will call the `createHttpOptions()` method on the instantiated object of the supplied class.

```typescript
@Injectable()
class HttpConfigService implements HttpModuleOptionsFactory {
  createHttpOptions(): HttpModuleOptions {
    return {
      timeout: 5000,
      maxRedirects: 5,
    };
  }
}
```

If you want to reuse an existing options provider instead of creating a private copy inside the `HttpModule`, use the `useExisting` syntax.

```typescript
HttpModule.registerAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useExisting: ConfigService,
});
```
### Model-View-Controller <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/mvc"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="mvc" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Nest, by default, makes use of the [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) library under the hood. Hence, every technique for using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern in Express applies to Nest as well.

First, let's scaffold a simple Nest application using the [CLI](https://github.com/nestjs/nest-cli) tool:

```bash
$ npm i -g @nestjs/cli
$ nest new project
```

In order to create an MVC app, we also need a [template engine](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html) to render our HTML views:

```bash
$ npm install --save hbs
```

We've used the `hbs` ([Handlebars](https://github.com/pillarjs/hbs#readme)) engine, though you can use whatever fits your requirements. Once the installation process is complete, we need to configure the express instance using the following code:

```typescript
@@filename(main)
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { NestExpressApplication } from '@nestjs/platform-express';
import { join } from 'path';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create<NestExpressApplication>(
    AppModule,
  );

  app.useStaticAssets(join(__dirname, '..', 'public'));
  app.setBaseViewsDir(join(__dirname, '..', 'views'));
  app.setViewEngine('hbs');

  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
@@switch
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { join } from 'path';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(
    AppModule,
  );

  app.useStaticAssets(join(__dirname, '..', 'public'));
  app.setBaseViewsDir(join(__dirname, '..', 'views'));
  app.setViewEngine('hbs');

  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

We told [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) that the `public` directory will be used for storing static assets, `views` will contain templates, and the `hbs` template engine should be used to render HTML output.

#### Template rendering

Now, let's create a `views` directory and `index.hbs` template inside it. In the template, we'll print a `message` passed from the controller:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    {{ "{{ message }\}" }}
  </body>
</html>
```

Next, open the `app.controller` file and replace the `root()` method with the following code:

```typescript
@@filename(app.controller)
import { Get, Controller, Render } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  @Get()
  @Render('index')
  root() {
    return { message: 'Hello world!' };
  }
}
```

In this code, we are specifying the template to use in the `@Render()` decorator, and the return value of the route handler method is passed to the template for rendering. Notice that the return value is an object with a property `message`, matching the `message` placeholder we created in the template.

While the application is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the `Hello world!` message.

#### Dynamic template rendering

If the application logic must dynamically decide which template to render, then we should use the `@Res()` decorator, and supply the view name in our route handler, rather than in the `@Render()` decorator:

> info **Hint** When Nest detects the `@Res()` decorator, it injects the library-specific `response` object. We can use this object to dynamically render the template. Learn more about the `response` object API [here](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html).

```typescript
@@filename(app.controller)
import { Get, Controller, Res, Render } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Response } from 'express';
import { AppService } from './app.service';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private appService: AppService) {}

  @Get()
  root(@Res() res: Response) {
    return res.render(
      this.appService.getViewName(),
      { message: 'Hello world!' },
    );
  }
}
```

#### Example

A working example is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/15-mvc).

#### Fastify

As mentioned in this [chapter](/techniques/performance), we are able to use any compatible HTTP provider together with Nest. One such library is [Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify). In order to create an MVC application with Fastify, we have to install the following packages:

```bash
$ npm i --save fastify point-of-view handlebars
```

The next steps cover almost the same process used with Express, with minor differences specific to the platform. Once the installation process is complete, open the `main.ts` file and update its contents:

```typescript
@@filename(main)
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { NestFastifyApplication, FastifyAdapter } from '@nestjs/platform-fastify';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import { join } from 'path';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create<NestFastifyApplication>(
    AppModule,
    new FastifyAdapter(),
  );
  app.useStaticAssets({
    root: join(__dirname, '..', 'public'),
    prefix: '/public/',
  });
  app.setViewEngine({
    engine: {
      handlebars: require('handlebars'),
    },
    templates: join(__dirname, '..', 'views'),
  });
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
@@switch
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { FastifyAdapter } from '@nestjs/platform-fastify';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import { join } from 'path';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule, new FastifyAdapter());
  app.useStaticAssets({
    root: join(__dirname, '..', 'public'),
    prefix: '/public/',
  });
  app.setViewEngine({
    engine: {
      handlebars: require('handlebars'),
    },
    templates: join(__dirname, '..', 'views'),
  });
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

The Fastify API is slightly different but the end result of those methods calls remains the same. One difference to notice with Fastify is that the template name passed into the `@Render()` decorator must include a file extension.

```typescript
@@filename(app.controller)
import { Get, Controller, Render } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  @Get()
  @Render('index.hbs')
  root() {
    return { message: 'Hello world!' };
  }
}
```

While the application is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the `Hello world!` message.

#### Example

A working example is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/17-mvc-fastify).
### Performance (Fastify) <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/performance"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="performance" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

By default, Nest makes use of the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework. As mentioned earlier, Nest also provides compatibility with other libraries such as, for example, [Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify). Nest achieves this framework independence by implementing a framework adapter whose primary function is to proxy middleware and handlers to appropriate library-specific implementations.

> info **Hint** Note that in order for a framework adapter to be implemented, the target library has to provide similar request/response pipeline processing as found in Express.

[Fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify) provides a good alternative framework for Nest because it solves design issues in a similar manner to Express. However, fastify is much **faster** than Express, achieving almost two times better benchmarks results. A fair question is why does Nest use Express as the default HTTP provider? The reason is that Express is widely-used, well-known, and has an enormous set of compatible middleware, which is available to Nest users out-of-the-box.

But since Nest provides framework-independence, you can easily migrate between them. Fastify can be a better choice when you place high value on very fast performance. To utilize Fastify, simply choose the built-in `FastifyAdapter` as shown in this chapter.

#### Installation

First, we need to install the required package:

```bash
$ npm i --save @nestjs/platform-fastify
```

#### Adapter

Once the Fastify platform is installed, we can use the `FastifyAdapter`.

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import {
  FastifyAdapter,
  NestFastifyApplication,
} from '@nestjs/platform-fastify';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create<NestFastifyApplication>(
    AppModule,
    new FastifyAdapter()
  );
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

By default, Fastify listens only on the `localhost 127.0.0.1` interface ([read more](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Getting-Started/#your-first-server)). If you want to accept connections on other hosts, you should specify `'0.0.0.0'` in the `listen()` call:

```typescript
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create<NestFastifyApplication>(
    AppModule,
    new FastifyAdapter()
  );
  await app.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0');
}
```

#### Platform specific packages

Keep in mind that when you use the `FastifyAdapter`, Nest uses Fastify as the **HTTP provider**. This means that each recipe that relies on Express may no longer work. You should, instead, use Fastify equivalent packages.

#### Redirect response

Fastify handles redirect responses slightly differently than Express. To do a proper redirect with Fastify, return both the status code and the URL, as follows:

```typescript
@Get()
index(@Res() res) {
  res.status(302).redirect('/login');
}
```

#### Fastify options

You can pass options into the Fastify constructor through the `FastifyAdapter` constructor. For example:

```typescript
new FastifyAdapter({ logger: true });
```

#### Example

A working example is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/10-fastify).

### Harnessing the power of TypeScript & GraphQL <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="quick-start" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a powerful query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It's an elegant approach that solves many problems typically found with REST APIs. For background, we suggest reading this [comparison](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/graphql-vs-rest-5d425123e34b) between GraphQL and REST. GraphQL combined with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) helps you develop better type safety with your GraphQL queries, giving you end-to-end typing.

In this chapter, we assume a basic understanding of GraphQL, and focus on how to work with the built-in `@nestjs/graphql` module. The `GraphQLModule` is a wrapper around the [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) server. We use this proven GraphQL package to provide a way to use GraphQL with Nest.

#### Installation

Start by installing the required packages:

```bash
$ npm i @nestjs/graphql graphql-tools graphql apollo-server-express
```
> info **Hint** If using Fastify, instead of installing `apollo-server-express`, you should install `apollo-server-fastify`.

#### Overview

Nest offers two ways of building GraphQL applications, the **code first** and the **schema first** methods. You should choose the one that works best for you. Most of the chapters in this GraphQL section are divided into two main parts: one you should follow if you adopt **code first**, and the other to be used if you adopt **schema first**.

In the **code first** approach, you use decorators and TypeScript classes to generate the corresponding GraphQL schema. This approach is useful if you prefer to work exclusively with TypeScript and avoid context switching between language syntaxes.

In the **schema first** approach, the source of truth is GraphQL SDL (Schema Definition Language) files. SDL is a language-agnostic way to share schema files between different platforms. Nest automatically generates your TypeScript definitions (using either classes or interfaces) based on the GraphQL schemas to reduce the need to write redundant boilerplate code.

#### Getting started with GraphQL & TypeScript

Once the packages are installed, we can import the `GraphQLModule` and configure it with the `forRoot()` static method.

```typescript
@@filename()
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { GraphQLModule } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLModule.forRoot({}),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The `forRoot()` method takes an options object as an argument. These options are passed through to the underlying Apollo instance (read more about available settings [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v2/api/apollo-server.html#constructor-options-lt-ApolloServer-gt)). For example, if you want to disable the `playground` and turn off `debug` mode, pass the following options:

```typescript
@@filename()
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { GraphQLModule } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLModule.forRoot({
      debug: false,
      playground: false,
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

As mentioned, these options will be forwarded to the `ApolloServer` constructor.

<app-banner-enterprise></app-banner-enterprise>

#### GraphQL playground

The playground is a graphical, interactive, in-browser GraphQL IDE, available by default on the same URL as the GraphQL server itself. To access the playground, you need a basic GraphQL server configured and running. To see it now, you can install and build the [working example here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/23-graphql-code-first). Alternatively, if you're following along with these code samples, once you've complete the steps in the [Resolvers chapter](/graphql/resolvers-map), you can access the playground.

With that in place, and with your application running in the background, you can then open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/graphql` (host and port may vary depending on your configuration). You will then see the GraphQL playground, as shown below.

<figure>
  <img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/playground.png" alt="" />
</figure>

#### Multiple endpoints

Another useful feature of the `@nestjs/graphql` module is the ability to serve multiple endpoints at once. This lets you decide which modules should be included in which endpoint. By default, `GraphQL` searches for resolvers throughout the whole app. To limit this scan to only a subset of modules, use the `include` property.

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot({
  include: [CatsModule],
}),
```

#### Code first

In the **code first** approach, you use decorators and TypeScript classes to generate the corresponding GraphQL schema.

To use the code first approach, start by adding the `autoSchemaFile` property to the options object:

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot({
  autoSchemaFile: join(process.cwd(), 'src/schema.gql'),
}),
```

The `autoSchemaFile` property value is the path where your automatically generated schema will be created. Alternatively, the schema can be generated on-the-fly in memory. To enable this, set the `autoSchemaFile` property to `true`:

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot({
  autoSchemaFile: true,
}),
```

By default, the types in the generated schema will be in the order they are defined in the included modules. To sort the schema lexicographically, set the `sortSchema` property to `true`:

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot({
  autoSchemaFile: join(process.cwd(), 'src/schema.gql'),
  sortSchema: true,
}),
```

A fully working code first sample is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/23-graphql-code-first).

#### Schema first

To use the schema first approach, start by adding a `typePaths` property to the options object. The `typePaths` property indicates where the `GraphQLModule` should look for GraphQL SDL schema definition files you'll be writing. These files will be combined in memory; this allows you to split your schemas into several files and locate them near their resolvers.

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot({
  typePaths: ['./**/*.graphql'],
}),
```

You will typically also need to have TypeScript definitions (classes and interfaces) that correspond to the GraphQL SDL types. Creating the corresponding TypeScript definitions by hand is redundant and tedious. It leaves us without a single source of truth -- each change made within SDL forces us to adjust TypeScript definitions as well. To address this, the `@nestjs/graphql` package can **automatically generate** TypeScript definitions from the abstract syntax tree ([AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)). To enable this feature, add the `definitions` options property when configuring the `GraphQLModule`.

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot({
  typePaths: ['./**/*.graphql'],
  definitions: {
    path: join(process.cwd(), 'src/graphql.ts'),
  },
}),
```

The path property of the `definitions` object indicates where to save generated TypeScript output. By default, all generated TypeScript types are created as interfaces. To generate classes instead, specify the `outputAs` property with a value of `'class'`.

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot({
  typePaths: ['./**/*.graphql'],
  definitions: {
    path: join(process.cwd(), 'src/graphql.ts'),
    outputAs: 'class',
  },
}),
```

The above approach dynamically generates TypeScript definitions each time the application starts. Alternatively, it may be preferable to build a simple script to generate these on demand. For example, assume we create the following script as `generate-typings.ts`:

```typescript
import { GraphQLDefinitionsFactory } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { join } from 'path';

const definitionsFactory = new GraphQLDefinitionsFactory();
definitionsFactory.generate({
  typePaths: ['./src/**/*.graphql'],
  path: join(process.cwd(), 'src/graphql.ts'),
  outputAs: 'class',
});
```

Now you can run this script on demand:

```bash
$ ts-node generate-typings
```

> info **Hint** You can compile the script beforehand (e.g., with `tsc`) and use `node` to execute it.

To enable watch mode for the script (to automatically generate typings whenever any `.graphql` file changes), pass the `watch` option to the `generate()` method.

```typescript
definitionsFactory.generate({
  typePaths: ['./src/**/*.graphql'],
  path: join(process.cwd(), 'src/graphql.ts'),
  outputAs: 'class',
  watch: true,
});
```

To automatically generate the additional `__typename` field for every object type, enable the `emitTypenameField` option.

```typescript
definitionsFactory.generate({
  // ...,
  emitTypenameField: true,
});
```

To generate resolvers (queries, mutations, subscriptions) as plain fields without arguments, enable the `skipResolverArgs` option.

```typescript
definitionsFactory.generate({
  // ...,
  skipResolverArgs: true,
});
```

A fully working schema first sample is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/12-graphql-schema-first).

#### Accessing generated schema

In some circumstances (for example end-to-end tests), you may want to get a reference to the generated schema object. In end-to-end tests, you can then run queries using the `graphql` object without using any HTTP listeners.

You can access the generated schema (in either the code first or schema first approach), using the `GraphQLSchemaHost` class:

```typescript
const { schema } = app.get(GraphQLSchemaHost);
```

> info **Hint** You must call the `GraphQLSchemaHost#schema` getter after the application has been initialized (after the `onModuleInit` hook has been triggered by either the `app.listen()` or `app.init()` method).

#### Async configuration

When you need to pass module options asynchronously instead of statically, use the `forRootAsync()` method. As with most dynamic modules, Nest provides several techniques to deal with async configuration.

One technique is to use a factory function:

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRootAsync({
  useFactory: () => ({
    typePaths: ['./**/*.graphql'],
  }),
}),
```

Like other factory providers, our factory function can be <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers#factory-providers-usefactory">async</a> and can inject dependencies through `inject`.

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRootAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useFactory: async (configService: ConfigService) => ({
    typePaths: configService.getString('GRAPHQL_TYPE_PATHS'),
  }),
  inject: [ConfigService],
}),
```

Alternatively, you can configure the `GraphQLModule` using a class instead of a factory, as shown below:

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRootAsync({
  useClass: GqlConfigService,
}),
```

The construction above instantiates `GqlConfigService` inside `GraphQLModule`, using it to create options object. Note that in this example, the `GqlConfigService` has to implement the `GqlOptionsFactory` interface, as shown below. The `GraphQLModule` will call the `createGqlOptions()` method on the instantiated object of the supplied class.

```typescript
@Injectable()
class GqlConfigService implements GqlOptionsFactory {
  createGqlOptions(): GqlModuleOptions {
    return {
      typePaths: ['./**/*.graphql'],
    };
  }
}
```

If you want to reuse an existing options provider instead of creating a private copy inside the `GraphQLModule`, use the `useExisting` syntax.

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRootAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  useExisting: ConfigService,
}),
```
### Resolvers <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/resolvers"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="resolvers" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Resolvers provide the instructions for turning a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) operation (a query, mutation, or subscription) into data. They return the same shape of data we specify in our schema -- either synchronously or as a promise that resolves to a result of that shape. Typically, you create a **resolver map** manually. The `@nestjs/graphql` package, on the other hand, generates a resolver map automatically using the metadata provided by decorators you use to annotate classes. To demonstrate the process of using the package features to create a GraphQL API, we'll create a simple authors API.

#### Code first

In the code first approach, we don't follow the typical process of creating our GraphQL schema by writing GraphQL SDL by hand. Instead, we use TypeScript decorators to generate the SDL from TypeScript class definitions. The `@nestjs/graphql` package reads the metadata defined through the decorators and automatically generates the schema for you.

#### Object types

Most of the definitions in a GraphQL schema are **object types**. Each object type you define should represent a domain object that an application client might need to interact with. For example, our sample API needs to be able to fetch a list of authors and their posts, so we should define the `Author` type and `Post` type to support this functionality.

If we were using the schema first approach, we'd define such a schema with SDL like this:

```graphql
type Author {
  id: Int!
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
  posts: [Post]
}
```

In this case, using the code first approach, we define schemas using TypeScript classes and using TypeScript decorators to annotate the fields of those classes. The equivalent of the above SDL in the code first approach is:

```typescript
@@filename(authors/models/author.model)
import { Field, Int, ObjectType } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { Post } from './post';

@ObjectType()
export class Author {
  @Field(type => Int)
  id: number;

  @Field({ nullable: true })
  firstName?: string;

  @Field({ nullable: true })
  lastName?: string;

  @Field(type => [Post])
  posts: Post[];
}
```

> info **Hint** TypeScript's metadata reflection system has several limitations which make it impossible, for instance, to determine what properties a class consists of or recognize whether a given property is optional or required. Because of these limitations, we must either explicitly use the `@Field()` decorator in our schema definition classes to provide metadata about each field's GraphQL type and optionality, or use a [CLI plugin](/graphql/cli-plugin) to generate these for us.

The `Author` object type, like any class, is made of a collection of fields, with each field declaring a type. A field's type corresponds to a [GraphQL type](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/). A field's GraphQL type can be either another object type or a scalar type. A GraphQL scalar type is a primitive (like `ID`, `String`, `Boolean`, or `Int`) that resolves to a single value.

> info **Hint** In addition to GraphQL's built-in scalar types, you can define custom scalar types (read [more](/graphql/scalars)).

The above `Author` object type definition will cause Nest to **generate** the SDL we showed above:

```graphql
type Author {
  id: Int!
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
  posts: [Post]
}
```

The `@Field()` decorator accepts an optional type function (e.g., `type => Int`), and optionally an options object.

The type function is required when there's the potential for ambiguity between the TypeScript type system and the GraphQL type system. Specifically: it is **not** required for `string` and `boolean` types; it **is** required for arrays, numbers (which must be mapped to either a GraphQL `Int` or `Float`) and object types. The type function should simply return the desired GraphQL type (as shown in various examples in these chapters).

The options object can have any of the following key/value pairs:

- `nullable`: for specifying whether a field is nullable (in SDL, each field is non-nullable by default); `boolean`
- `description`: for setting a field description; `string`
- `deprecationReason`: for marking a field as deprecated; `string`

For example:

```typescript
@Field({ description: `Book title`, deprecationReason: 'Not useful in v2 schema' })
title: string;
```

> info **Hint** You can also add a description to, or deprecate, the whole object type: `@ObjectType({{ '{' }} description: 'Author model' {{ '}' }})`.

When the field is an array, we must manually indicate the array type in the `Field()` decorator's type function, as shown below:

```typescript
@Field(type => [Post])
posts: Post[];
```

> info **Hint** Using array bracket notation (`[ ]`), we can indicate the depth of the array. For example, using `[[Int]]` would represent an integer matrix.

To declare that an array's items (not the array itself) are nullable, set the `nullable` property to `'items'` as shown below:

```typescript
@Field(type => [Post], { nullable: 'items' })
posts: Post[];
```

> info **Hint** If both the array and its items are nullable, set `nullable` to `'itemsAndList'` instead.

Now that the `Author` object type is created, let's define the `Post` object type.

```typescript
@@filename(posts/models/post.model)
import { Field, Int, ObjectType } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@ObjectType()
export class Post {
  @Field(type => Int)
  id: number;

  @Field()
  title: string;

  @Field(type => Int, { nullable: true })
  votes?: number;
}
```

The `Post` object type will result in generating the following part of the GraphQL schema in SDL:

```graphql
@@filename(schema.gql)
type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String!
  votes: Int
}
```

#### Code first resolver

At this point, we've defined the objects (type definitions) that can exist in our data graph, but clients don't yet have a way to interact with those objects. To address that, we need to create a resolver class. In the code first method, a resolver class both defines resolver functions **and** generates the **Query type**. This will be clear as we work through the example below:

```typescript
@@filename(authors/authors.resolver)
@Resolver(of => Author)
export class AuthorsResolver {
  constructor(
    private authorsService: AuthorsService,
    private postsService: PostsService,
  ) {}

  @Query(returns => Author)
  async author(@Args('id', { type: () => Int }) id: number) {
    return this.authorsService.findOneById(id);
  }

  @ResolveField()
  async posts(@Parent() author: Author) {
    const { id } = author;
    return this.postsService.findAll({ authorId: id });
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** All decorators (e.g., `@Resolver`, `@ResolveField`, `@Args`, etc.) are exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package.

You can define multiple resolver classes. Nest will combine these at run time. See the [module](/graphql/resolvers#module) section below for more on code organization.

> warning **Note** The logic inside the `AuthorsService` and `PostsService` classes can be as simple or sophisticated as needed. The main point of this example is to show how to construct resolvers and how they can interact with other providers.

In the example above, we created the `AuthorsResolver` which defines one query resolver function and one field resolver function. To create a resolver, we create a class with resolver functions as methods, and annotate the class with the `@Resolver()` decorator.

In this example, we defined a query handler to get the author object based on the `id` sent in the request. To specify that the method is a query handler, use the `@Query()` decorator.

The argument passed to the `@Resolver()` decorator is optional, but comes into play when our graph becomes non-trivial. It's used to supply a parent object used by field resolver functions as they traverse down through an object graph.

In our example, since the class includes a **field resolver** function (for the `posts` property of the `Author` object type), we **must** supply the `@Resolver()` decorator with a value to indicate which class is the parent type (i.e., the corresponding `ObjectType` class name) for all field resolvers defined within this class. As should be clear from the example, when writing a field resolver function, it's necessary to access the parent object (the object the field being resolved is a member of). In this example, we populate an author's posts array with a field resolver that calls a service which takes the author's `id` as an argument. Hence the need to identify the parent object in the `@Resolver()` decorator. Note the corresponding use of the `@Parent()` method parameter decorator to then extract a reference to that parent object in the field resolver.

We can define multiple `@Query()` resolver functions (both within this class, and in any other resolver class), and they will be aggregated into a single **Query type** definition in the generated SDL along with the appropriate entries in the resolver map. This allows you to define queries close to the models and services that they use, and to keep them well organized in modules.

#### Query type names

In the above examples, the `@Query()` decorator generates a GraphQL schema query type name based on the method name. For example, consider the following construction from the example above:

```typescript
@Query(returns => Author)
async author(@Args('id', { type: () => Int }) id: number) {
  return this.authorsService.findOneById(id);
}
```

This generates the following entry for the author query in our schema (the query type uses the same name as the method name):

```graphql
type Query {
  author(id: Int!): Author
}
```

> info **Hint** Learn more about GraphQL queries [here](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/).

Conventionally, we prefer to decouple these names; for example, we prefer to use a name like `getAuthor()` for our query handler method, but still use `author` for our query type name. The same applies to our field resolvers. We can easily do this by passing the mapping names as arguments of the `@Query()` and `@ResolveField()` decorators, as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename(authors/authors.resolver)
@Resolver(of => Author)
export class AuthorsResolver {
  constructor(
    private authorsService: AuthorsService,
    private postsService: PostsService,
  ) {}

  @Query(returns => Author, { name: 'author' })
  async getAuthor(@Args('id', { type: () => Int }) id: number) {
    return this.authorsService.findOneById(id);
  }

  @ResolveField('posts', returns => [Post])
  async getPosts(@Parent() author: Author) {
    const { id } = author;
    return this.postsService.findAll({ authorId: id });
  }
}
```

The `getAuthor` handler method above will result in generating the following part of the GraphQL schema in SDL:

```graphql
type Query {
  author(id: Int!): Author
}
```

#### Query decorator options

The `@Query()` decorator's options object (where we pass `{{ '{' }}name: 'author'{{ '}' }}` above) accepts a number of key/value pairs:

- `name`: name of the query; a `string`
- `description`: a description that will be used to generate GraphQL schema documentation (e.g., in GraphQL playground); a `string`
- `deprecationReason`: sets query metadata to show the query as deprecated (e.g., in GraphQL playground); a `string`
- `nullable`: whether the query can return a null data response; `boolean` or `'items'` or `'itemsAndList'` (see above for details of `'items'` and `'itemsAndList'`)

#### Args decorator options

Use the `@Args()` decorator to extract arguments from a request for use in the method handler. This works in a very similar fashion to [REST route parameter argument extraction](/controllers#route-parameters).

Usually your `@Args()` decorator will be simple, and not require an object argument as seen with the `getAuthor()` method above. For example, if the type of an identifier is string, the following construction is sufficient, and simply plucks the named field from the inbound GraphQL request for use as a method argument.

```typescript
@Args('id') id: string
```

In the `getAuthor()` case, the `number` type is used, which presents a challenge. The `number` TypeScript type doesn't give us enough information about the expected GraphQL representation (e.g., `Int` vs. `Float`). Thus we have to **explicitly** pass the type reference. We do that by passing a second argument to the `Args()` decorator, containing argument options, as shown below:

```typescript
@Query(returns => Author, { name: 'author' })
async getAuthor(@Args('id', { type: () => Int }) id: number) {
  return this.authorsService.findOneById(id);
}
```

The options object allows us to specify the following optional key value pairs:

- `type`: a function returning the GraphQL type
- `defaultValue`: a default value; `any`
- `description`: description metadata; `string`
- `deprecationReason`: to deprecate a field and provide meta data describing why; `string`
- `nullable`: whether the field is nullable

Query handler methods can take multiple arguments. Let's imagine that we want to fetch an author based on its `firstName` and `lastName`. In this case, we can call `@Args` twice:

```typescript
getAuthor(
  @Args('firstName', { nullable: true }) firstName?: string,
  @Args('lastName', { defaultValue: '' }) lastName?: string,
) {}
```

#### Dedicated arguments class

With inline `@Args()` calls, code like the example above becomes bloated. Instead, you can create a dedicated `GetAuthorArgs` arguments class and access it in the handler method as follows:

```typescript
@Args() args: GetAuthorArgs
```

Create the `GetAuthorArgs` class using `@ArgsType()` as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename(authors/dto/get-author.args)
import { MinLength } from 'class-validator';
import { Field, ArgsType } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@ArgsType()
class GetAuthorArgs {
  @Field({ nullable: true })
  firstName?: string;

  @Field({ defaultValue: '' })
  @MinLength(3)
  lastName: string;
}
```

> info **Hint** Again, due to TypeScript's metadata reflection system limitations, it's required to either use the `@Field` decorator to manually indicate type and optionality, or use a [CLI plugin](/graphql/cli-plugin).

This will result in generating the following part of the GraphQL schema in SDL:

```graphql
type Query {
  author(firstName: String, lastName: String = ''): Author
}
```

> info **Hint** Note that arguments classes like `GetAuthorArgs` play very well with the `ValidationPipe` (read [more](/techniques/validation)).

#### Class inheritance

You can use standard TypeScript class inheritance to create base classes with generic utility type features (fields and field properties, validations, etc.) that can be extended. For example, you may have a set of pagination related arguments that always include the standard `offset` and `limit` fields, but also other index fields that are type-specific. You can set up a class hierarchy as shown below.

Base `@ArgsType()` class:

```typescript
@ArgsType()
class PaginationArgs {
  @Field((type) => Int)
  offset: number = 0;

  @Field((type) => Int)
  limit: number = 10;
}
```

Type specific sub-class of the base `@ArgsType()` class:

```typescript
@ArgsType()
class GetAuthorArgs extends PaginationArgs {
  @Field({ nullable: true })
  firstName?: string;

  @Field({ defaultValue: '' })
  @MinLength(3)
  lastName: string;
}
```

The same approach can be taken with `@ObjectType()` objects. Define generic properties on the base class:

```typescript
@ObjectType()
class Character {
  @Field((type) => Int)
  id: number;

  @Field()
  name: string;
}
```

Add type-specific properties on sub-classes:

```typescript
@ObjectType()
class Warrior extends Character {
  @Field()
  level: number;
}
```

You can use inheritance with a resolver as well. You can ensure type safety by combining inheritance and TypeScript generics. For example, to create a base class with a generic `findAll` query, use a construction like this:

```typescript
function BaseResolver<T extends Type<unknown>>(classRef: T): any {
  @Resolver({ isAbstract: true })
  abstract class BaseResolverHost {
    @Query((type) => [classRef], { name: `findAll${classRef.name}` })
    async findAll(): Promise<T[]> {
      return [];
    }
  }
  return BaseResolverHost;
}
```

Note the following:

- an explicit return type (`any` above) is required: otherwise TypeScript complains about the usage of a private class definition. Recommended: define an interface instead of using `any`.
- `Type` is imported from the `@nestjs/common` package
- The `isAbstract: true` property indicates that SDL (Schema Definition Language statements) shouldn't be generated for this class. Note, you can set this property for other types as well to suppress SDL generation.

Here's how you could generate a concrete sub-class of the `BaseResolver`:

```typescript
@Resolver((of) => Recipe)
export class RecipesResolver extends BaseResolver(Recipe) {
  constructor(private recipesService: RecipesService) {
    super();
  }
}
```

This construct would generated the following SDL:

```graphql
type Query {
  findAllRecipe: [Recipe!]!
}
```

#### Generics

We saw one use of generics above. This powerful TypeScript feature can be used to create useful abstractions. For example, here's a sample cursor-based pagination implementation based on [this documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/pagination/#pagination-and-edges):

```typescript
import { Field, ObjectType, Int } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { Type } from '@nestjs/common';

export function Paginated<T>(classRef: Type<T>): any {
  @ObjectType(`${classRef.name}Edge`)
  abstract class EdgeType {
    @Field((type) => String)
    cursor: string;

    @Field((type) => classRef)
    node: T;
  }

  @ObjectType({ isAbstract: true })
  abstract class PaginatedType {
    @Field((type) => [EdgeType], { nullable: true })
    edges: EdgeType[];

    @Field((type) => [classRef], { nullable: true })
    nodes: T[];

    @Field((type) => Int)
    totalCount: number;

    @Field()
    hasNextPage: boolean;
  }
  return PaginatedType;
}
```

With the above base class defined, we can now easily create specialized types that inherit this behavior. For example:

```typescript
@ObjectType()
class PaginatedAuthor extends Paginated(Author) {}
```

#### Schema first

As mentioned in the [previous](/graphql/quick-start) chapter, in the schema first approach we start by manually defining schema types in SDL (read [more](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#type-language)). Consider the following SDL type definitions.

> info **Hint** For convenience in this chapter, we've aggregated all of the SDL in one location (e.g., one `.graphql` file, as shown below). In practice, you may find it appropriate to organize your code in a modular fashion. For example, it can be helpful to create individual SDL files with type definitions representing each domain entity, along with related services, resolver code, and the Nest module definition class, in a dedicated directory for that entity. Nest will aggregate all the individual schema type definitions at run time.

```graphql
type Author {
  id: Int!
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
  posts: [Post]
}

type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String!
  votes: Int
}

type Query {
  author(id: Int!): Author
}
```

#### Schema first resolver

The schema above exposes a single query - `author(id: Int!): Author`.

> info **Hint** Learn more about GraphQL queries [here](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/).

Let's now create an `AuthorsResolver` class that resolves author queries:

```typescript
@@filename(authors/authors.resolver)
@Resolver('Author')
export class AuthorsResolver {
  constructor(
    private authorsService: AuthorsService,
    private postsService: PostsService,
  ) {}

  @Query()
  async author(@Args('id') id: number) {
    return this.authorsService.findOneById(id);
  }

  @ResolveField()
  async posts(@Parent() author) {
    const { id } = author;
    return this.postsService.findAll({ authorId: id });
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** All decorators (e.g., `@Resolver`, `@ResolveField`, `@Args`, etc.) are exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package.

> warning **Note** The logic inside the `AuthorsService` and `PostsService` classes can be as simple or sophisticated as needed. The main point of this example is to show how to construct resolvers and how they can interact with other providers.

The `@Resolver()` decorator is required. It takes an optional string argument with the name of a class. This class name is required whenever the class includes `@ResolveField()` decorators to inform Nest that the decorated method is associated with a parent type (the `Author` type in our current example). Alternatively, instead of setting `@Resolver()` at the top of the class, this can be done for each method:

```typescript
@Resolver('Author')
@ResolveField()
async posts(@Parent() author) {
  const { id } = author;
  return this.postsService.findAll({ authorId: id });
}
```

In this case (`@Resolver()` decorator at the method level), if you have multiple `@ResolveField()` decorators inside a class, you must add `@Resolver()` to all of them. This is not considered the best practice (as it creates extra overhead).

> info **Hint** Any class name argument passed to `@Resolver()` **does not** affect queries (`@Query()` decorator) or mutations (`@Mutation()` decorator).

> warning **Warning** Using the `@Resolver` decorator at the method level is not supported with the **code first** approach.

In the above examples, the `@Query()` and `@ResolveField()` decorators are associated with GraphQL schema types based on the method name. For example, consider the following construction from the example above:

```typescript
@Query()
async author(@Args('id') id: number) {
  return this.authorsService.findOneById(id);
}
```

This generates the following entry for the author query in our schema (the query type uses the same name as the method name):

```graphql
type Query {
  author(id: Int!): Author
}
```

Conventionally, we would prefer to decouple these, using names like `getAuthor()` or `getPosts()` for our resolver methods. We can easily do this by passing the mapping name as an argument to the decorator, as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename(authors/authors.resolver)
@Resolver('Author')
export class AuthorsResolver {
  constructor(
    private authorsService: AuthorsService,
    private postsService: PostsService,
  ) {}

  @Query('author')
  async getAuthor(@Args('id') id: number) {
    return this.authorsService.findOneById(id);
  }

  @ResolveField('posts')
  async getPosts(@Parent() author) {
    const { id } = author;
    return this.postsService.findAll({ authorId: id });
  }
}
```

#### Generating types

Assuming that we use the schema first approach and have enabled the typings generation feature (with `outputAs: 'class'` as shown in the [previous](/graphql/quick-start) chapter), once you run the application it will generate the following file (in the location you specified in the `GraphQLModule.forRoot()` method. For example, in `src/graphql.ts`)

```typescript
@@filename(graphql)
export class Author {
  id: number;
  firstName?: string;
  lastName?: string;
  posts?: Post[];
}

export class Post {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  votes?: number;
}

export abstract class IQuery {
  abstract author(id: number): Author | Promise<Author>;
}
```

By generating classes (instead of the default technique of generating interfaces), you can use declarative validation **decorators** in combination with the schema first approach, which is an extremely useful technique (read [more](/techniques/validation)). For example, you could add `class-validator` decorators to the generated `CreatePostInput` class as shown below to enforce minimum and maximum string lengths on the `title` field:

```typescript
import { MinLength, MaxLength } from 'class-validator';

export class CreatePostInput {
  @MinLength(3)
  @MaxLength(50)
  title: string;
}
```

> warning **Notice** To enable auto-validation of your inputs (and parameters), use `ValidationPipe`. Read more about validation [here](/techniques/validation) and more specifically about pipes [here](/pipes).

However, if you add decorators directly to the automatically generated file, they will be **overwritten** each time the file is generated. Instead, create a separate file and simply extend the generated class.

```typescript
import { MinLength, MaxLength } from 'class-validator';
import { Post } from '../../graphql.ts';

export class CreatePostInput extends Post {
  @MinLength(3)
  @MaxLength(50)
  title: string;
}
```

#### GraphQL argument decorators

We can access the standard GraphQL resolver arguments using dedicated decorators. Below is a comparison of the Nest decorators and the plain Apollo parameters they represent.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Root()</code> and <code>@Parent()</code></td>
      <td><code>root</code>/<code>parent</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Context(param?: string)</code></td>
      <td><code>context</code> / <code>context[param]</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Info(param?: string)</code></td>
      <td><code>info</code> / <code>info[param]</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>@Args(param?: string)</code></td>
      <td><code>args</code> / <code>args[param]</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

These arguments have the following meanings:

- `root`: an object that contains the result returned from the resolver on the parent field, or, in the case of a top-level `Query` field, the `rootValue` passed from the server configuration.
- `context`: an object shared by all resolvers in a particular query; typically used to contain per-request state.
- `info`: an object that contains information about the execution state of the query.
- `args`: an object with the arguments passed into the field in the query.

<app-banner-shop></app-banner-shop>

#### Module

Once we're done with the above steps, we have declaratively specified all the information needed by the `GraphQLModule` to generate a resolver map. The `GraphQLModule` uses reflection to introspect the meta data provided via the decorators, and transforms classes into the correct resolver map automatically.

The only other thing you need to take care of is to **provide** (i.e., list as a `provider` in some module) the resolver class(es) (`AuthorsResolver`), and importing the module (`AuthorsModule`) somewhere, so Nest will be able to utilize it.

For example, we can do this in an `AuthorsModule`, which can also provide other services needed in this context. Be sure to import `AuthorsModule` somewhere (e.g., in the root module, or some other module imported by the root module).

```typescript
@@filename(authors/authors.module)
@Module({
  imports: [PostsModule],
  providers: [AuthorsService, AuthorsResolver],
})
export class AuthorsModule {}
```

> info **Hint** It is helpful to organize your code by your so-called **domain model** (similar to the way you would organize entry points in a REST API). In this approach, keep your models (`ObjectType` classes), resolvers and services together within a Nest module representing the domain model. Keep all of these components in a single folder per module. When you do this, and use the [Nest CLI](/cli/overview) to generate each element, Nest will wire all of these parts together (locating files in appropriate folders, generating entries in `provider` and `imports` arrays, etc.) automatically for you.
### Mutations <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/mutations"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="mutations" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Most discussions of GraphQL focus on data fetching, but any complete data platform needs a way to modify server-side data as well. In REST, any request could end up causing side-effects on the server, but best practice suggests we should not modify data in GET requests. GraphQL is similar - technically any query could be implemented to cause a data write. However, like REST, it's recommended to observe the convention that any operations that cause writes should be sent explicitly via a mutation (read more [here](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations)).

The official [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/generate-schema.html) documentation uses an `upvotePost()` mutation example. This mutation implements a method to increase a post's `votes` property value. To create an equivalent mutation in Nest, we'll make use of the `@Mutation()` decorator.

#### Code first

Let's add another method to the `AuthorResolver` used in the previous section (see [resolvers](/graphql/resolvers)).

```typescript
@Mutation(returns => Post)
async upvotePost(@Args({ name: 'postId', type: () => Int }) postId: number) {
  return this.postsService.upvoteById({ id: postId });
}
```

> info **Hint** All decorators (e.g., `@Resolver`, `@ResolveField`, `@Args`, etc.) are exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package.

This will result in generating the following part of the GraphQL schema in SDL:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  upvotePost(postId: Int!): Post
}
```

The `upvotePost()` method takes `postId` (`Int`) as an argument and returns an updated `Post` entity. For the reasons explained in the [resolvers](/graphql/resolvers) section, we have to explicitly set the expected type.

If the mutation needs to take an object as an argument, we can create an **input type**. The input type is a special kind of object type that can be passed in as an argument (read more [here](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#input-types)). To declare an input type, use the `@InputType()` decorator.

```typescript
import { InputType, Field } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@InputType()
export class UpvotePostInput {
  @Field()
  postId: number;
}
```

> info **Hint** The `@InputType()` decorator takes an options object as an argument, so you can, for example, specify the input type's description. Note that, due to TypeScript's metadata reflection system limitations, you must either use the `@Field` decorator to manually indicate a type, or use a [CLI plugin](/graphql/cli-plugin).

We can then use this type in the resolver class:

```typescript
@Mutation(returns => Post)
async upvotePost(
  @Args('upvotePostData') upvotePostData: UpvotePostInput,
) {}
```

#### Schema first

Let's extend our `AuthorResolver` used in the previous section (see [resolvers](/graphql/resolvers)).

```typescript
@Mutation()
async upvotePost(@Args('postId') postId: number) {
  return this.postsService.upvoteById({ id: postId });
}
```

Note that we assumed above that the business logic has been moved to the `PostsService` (querying the post and incrementing its `votes` property). The logic inside the `PostsService` class can be as simple or sophisticated as needed. The main point of this example is to show how resolvers can interact with other providers.

The last step is to add our mutation to the existing types definition.

```graphql
type Author {
  id: Int!
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
  posts: [Post]
}

type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String
  votes: Int
}

type Query {
  author(id: Int!): Author
}

type Mutation {
  upvotePost(postId: Int!): Post
}
```

The `upvotePost(postId: Int!): Post` mutation is now available to be called as part of our application's GraphQL API.
### Subscriptions <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/subscriptions"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="subscriptions" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

In addition to fetching data using queries and modifying data using mutations, the GraphQL spec supports a third operation type, called `subscription`. GraphQL subscriptions are a way to push data from the server to the clients that choose to listen to real time messages from the server. Subscriptions are similar to queries in that they specify a set of fields to be delivered to the client, but instead of immediately returning a single answer, a channel is opened and a result is sent to the client every time a particular event happens on the server.

A common use case for subscriptions is notifying the client side about particular events, for example the creation of a new object, updated fields and so on (read more [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions)).

#### Enable subscriptions

To enable subscriptions, set the `installSubscriptionHandlers` property to `true`.

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot({
  installSubscriptionHandlers: true,
}),
```

#### Code first

To create a subscription using the code first approach, we use the `@Subscription()` decorator and the `PubSub` class from the `graphql-subscriptions` package, which provides a simple **publish/subscribe API**.

The following subscription handler takes care of **subscribing** to an event by calling `PubSub#asyncIterator`. This method takes a single argument, the `triggerName`, which corresponds to an event topic name.

```typescript
const pubSub = new PubSub();

@Resolver(of => Author)
export class AuthorResolver {
  // ...
  @Subscription(returns => Comment)
  commentAdded() {
    return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** All decorators are exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package, while the `PubSub` class is exported from the `graphql-subscriptions` package.

> warning **Note** `PubSub` is a class that exposes a simple `publish` and `subscribe API`. Read more about it [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-subscriptions/setup.html). Note that the Apollo docs warn that the default implementation is not suitable for production (read more [here](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions#getting-started-with-your-first-subscription)). Production apps should use a `PubSub` implementation backed by an external store (read more [here](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions#pubsub-implementations)).

This will result in generating the following part of the GraphQL schema in SDL:

```graphql
type Subscription {
  commentAdded(): Comment!
}
```

Note that subscriptions, by definition, return an object with a single top level property whose key is the name of the subscription. This name is either inherited from the name of the subscription handler method (i.e., `commentAdded` above), or is provided explicitly by passing an option with the key `name` as the second argument to the `@Subscription()` decorator, as shown below.

```typescript
  @Subscription(returns => Comment, {
    name: 'commentAdded',
  })
  addCommentHandler() {
    return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
  }
```

This construct produces the same SDL as the previous code sample, but allows us to decouple the method name from the subscription.

#### Publishing

Now, to publish the event, we use the `PubSub#publish` method. This is often used within a mutation to trigger a client-side update when a part of the object graph has changed. For example:

```typescript
@@filename(posts/posts.resolver)
@Mutation(returns => Post)
async addComment(
  @Args('postId', { type: () => Int }) postId: number,
  @Args('comment', { type: () => Comment }) comment: CommentInput,
) {
  const newComment = this.commentsService.addComment({ id: postId, comment });
  pubSub.publish('commentAdded', { commentAdded: newComment });
  return newComment;
}
```

The `PubSub#publish` method takes a `triggerName` (again, think of this as an event topic name) as the first parameter, and an event payload as the second parameter. As mentioned, the subscription, by definition, returns a value and that value has a shape. Look again at the generated SDL for our `commentAdded` subscription:

```graphql
type Subscription {
  commentAdded(): Comment!
}
```

This tells us that the subscription must return an object with a top-level property name of `commentAdded` that has a value which is a `Comment` object. The important point to note is that the shape of the event payload emitted by the `PubSub#publish` method must correspond to the shape of the value expected to return from the subscription. So, in our example above, the `pubSub.publish('commentAdded', {{ '{' }} commentAdded: newComment {{ '}' }})` statement publishes a `commentAdded` event with the appropriately shaped payload. If these shapes don't match, your subscription will fail during the GraphQL validation phase.

#### Filtering subscriptions

To filter out specific events, set the `filter` property to a filter function. This function acts similar to the function passed to an array `filter`. It takes two arguments: `payload` containing the event payload (as sent by the event publisher), and `variables` taking any arguments passed in during the subscription request. It returns a boolean determining whether this event should be published to client listeners.

```typescript
@Subscription(returns => Comment, {
  filter: (payload, variables) =>
    payload.commentAdded.title === variables.title,
})
commentAdded(@Args('title') title: string) {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

#### Mutating subscription payloads

To mutate the published event payload, set the `resolve` property to a function. The function receives the event payload (as sent by the event publisher) and returns the appropriate value.

```typescript
@Subscription(returns => Comment, {
  resolve: value => value,
})
commentAdded() {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

> warning **Note** If you use the `resolve` option, you should return the unwrapped payload (e.g., with our example, return a `newComment` object directly, not a `{{ '{' }} commentAdded: newComment {{ '}' }}` object).

If you need to access injected providers (e.g., use an external service to validate the data), use the following construction.

```typescript
@Subscription(returns => Comment, {
  resolve(this: AuthorResolver, value) {
    // "this" refers to an instance of "AuthorResolver"
    return value;
  }
})
commentAdded() {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

The same construction works with filters:

```typescript
@Subscription(returns => Comment, {
  filter(this: AuthorResolver, payload, variables) {
    // "this" refers to an instance of "AuthorResolver"
    return payload.commentAdded.title === variables.title;
  }
})
commentAdded() {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

#### Schema first

To create an equivalent subscription in Nest, we'll make use of the `@Subscription()` decorator.

```typescript
const pubSub = new PubSub();

@Resolver('Author')
export class AuthorResolver {
  // ...
  @Subscription()
  commentAdded() {
    return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
  }
}
```

To filter out specific events based on context and arguments, set the `filter` property.

```typescript
@Subscription('commentAdded', {
  filter: (payload, variables) =>
    payload.commentAdded.title === variables.title,
})
commentAdded() {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

To mutate the published payload, we can use a `resolve` function.

```typescript
@Subscription('commentAdded', {
  resolve: value => value,
})
commentAdded() {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

If you need to access injected providers (e.g., use an external service to validate the data), use the following construction:

```typescript
@Subscription('commentAdded', {
  resolve(this: AuthorResolver, value) {
    // "this" refers to an instance of "AuthorResolver"
    return value;
  }
})
commentAdded() {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

The same construction works with filters:

```typescript
@Subscription('commentAdded', {
  filter(this: AuthorResolver, payload, variables) {
    // "this" refers to an instance of "AuthorResolver"
    return payload.commentAdded.title === variables.title;
  }
})
commentAdded() {
  return pubSub.asyncIterator('commentAdded');
}
```

The last step is to update the type definitions file.

```graphql
type Author {
  id: Int!
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
  posts: [Post]
}

type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String
  votes: Int
}

type Query {
  author(id: Int!): Author
}

type Comment {
  id: String
  content: String
}

type Subscription {
  commentAdded(title: String!): Comment
}
```

With this, we've created a single `commentAdded(title: String!): Comment` subscription. You can find a full sample implementation [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/blob/master/sample/12-graphql-schema-first).

#### PubSub

We instantiated a local `PubSub` instance above. The preferred approach is to define `PubSub` as a [provider](/fundamentals/custom-providers) and inject it through the constructor (using the `@Inject()` decorator). This allows us to re-use the instance across the whole application. For example, define a provider as follows, then inject `'PUB_SUB'` where needed.

```typescript
{
  provide: 'PUB_SUB',
  useValue: new PubSub(),
}
```

#### Customize subscriptions server

To customize the subscriptions server (e.g., change the listener port), use the `subscriptions` options property (read [more](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v2/api/apollo-server.html#constructor-options-lt-ApolloServer-gt)).

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot({
  installSubscriptionHandlers: true,
  subscriptions: {
    keepAlive: 5000,
  }
}),
```
### Scalars <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/scalars"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="scalars" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

A GraphQL object type has a name and fields, but at some point those fields have to resolve to some concrete data. That's where the scalar types come in: they represent the leaves of the query (read more [here](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types)). GraphQL includes the following default types: `Int`, `Float`, `String`, `Boolean` and `ID`. In addition to these built-in types, you may need to support custom atomic data types (e.g., `Date`).

#### Code first

The code-first approach ships with five scalars in which three of them are simple aliases for the existing GraphQL types.

- `ID` (alias for `GraphQLID`) - represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as the key for a cache
- `Int` (alias for `GraphQLInt`) - a signed 32‚Äêbit integer
- `Float` (alias for `GraphQLFloat`) - a signed double-precision floating-point value
- `GraphQLISODateTime` - a date-time string at UTC (used by default to represent `Date` type)
- `GraphQLTimestamp` - a numeric string which represents time and date as number of milliseconds from start of UNIX epoch

The `GraphQLISODateTime` (e.g. `2019-12-03T09:54:33Z`) is used by default to represent the `Date` type. To use the `GraphQLTimestamp` instead, set the `dateScalarMode` of the `buildSchemaOptions` object to `'timestamp'` as follows:

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot({
  buildSchemaOptions: {
    dateScalarMode: 'timestamp',
  }
}),
```

In addition, you can create custom scalars. For example, to create a `Date` scalar, simply create a new class.

```typescript
import { Scalar, CustomScalar } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { Kind, ValueNode } from 'graphql';

@Scalar('Date', type => Date)
export class DateScalar implements CustomScalar<number, Date> {
  description = 'Date custom scalar type';

  parseValue(value: number): Date {
    return new Date(value); // value from the client
  }

  serialize(value: Date): number {
    return value.getTime(); // value sent to the client
  }

  parseLiteral(ast: ValueNode): Date {
    if (ast.kind === Kind.INT) {
      return new Date(ast.value);
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

With this in place, register `DateScalar` as a provider.

```typescript
@Module({
  providers: [DateScalar],
})
export class CommonModule {}
```

Now we can use the `Date` type in our classes.

```typescript
@Field()
creationDate: Date;
```

#### Schema first

To define a custom scalar (read more about scalars [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/scalars.html)), create a type definition and a dedicated resolver. Here (as in the official documentation), we‚Äôll use the `graphql-type-json` package for demonstration purposes. This npm package defines a `JSON` GraphQL scalar type.

Start by installing the package:

```bash
$ npm i --save graphql-type-json
```

Once the package is installed, we pass a custom resolver to the `forRoot()` method:

```typescript
import GraphQLJSON from 'graphql-type-json';

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLModule.forRoot({
      typePaths: ['./**/*.graphql'],
      resolvers: { JSON: GraphQLJSON },
    }),
  ],
})
export class ApplicationModule {}
```

Now we can use the `JSON` scalar in our type definitions:

```graphql
scalar JSON

type Foo {
  field: JSON
}
```

Another method to define a scalar type is to create a simple class. Assume we want to enhance our schema with the `Date` type.

```typescript
import { Scalar, CustomScalar } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { Kind, ValueNode } from 'graphql';

@Scalar('Date')
export class DateScalar implements CustomScalar<number, Date> {
  description = 'Date custom scalar type';

  parseValue(value: number): Date {
    return new Date(value); // value from the client
  }

  serialize(value: Date): number {
    return value.getTime(); // value sent to the client
  }

  parseLiteral(ast: ValueNode): Date {
    if (ast.kind === Kind.INT) {
      return new Date(ast.value);
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

With this in place, register `DateScalar` as a provider.

```typescript
@Module({
  providers: [DateScalar],
})
export class CommonModule {}
```

Now we can use the `Date` scalar in type definitions.

```graphql
scalar Date
```
### Directives <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/directives"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="directives" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

A directive can be attached to a field or fragment inclusion, and can affect execution of the query in any way the server desires (read more [here](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#directives)). The GraphQL specification provides several default directives:

- `@include(if: Boolean)` - only include this field in the result if the argument is true
- `@skip(if: Boolean)` - skip this field if the argument is true
- `@deprecated(reason: String)` - marks field as deprecated with message

A directive is an identifier preceded by a `@` character, optionally followed by a list of named arguments, which can appear after almost any element in the GraphQL query and schema languages.

#### Custom directives

To create a custom schema directive, declare a class which extends the `SchemaDirectiveVisitor` class exported from the `apollo-server` package.

```typescript
import { SchemaDirectiveVisitor } from 'apollo-server';
import { defaultFieldResolver, GraphQLField } from 'graphql';

export class UpperCaseDirective extends SchemaDirectiveVisitor {
  visitFieldDefinition(field: GraphQLField<any, any>) {
    const { resolve = defaultFieldResolver } = field;
    field.resolve = async function(...args) {
      const result = await resolve.apply(this, args);
      if (typeof result === 'string') {
        return result.toUpperCase();
      }
      return result;
    };
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** Note that directives cannot be decorated with the `@Injectable()` decorator. Thus, they are not able to inject dependencies.

Now, register the `UpperCaseDirective` in the `GraphQLModule.forRoot()` method:

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot({
  // ...
  schemaDirectives: {
    upper: UpperCaseDirective,
  },
});
```

Once registered, the `@upper` directive can be used in our schema. However, the way you apply the directive will vary depending on the approach you use (code first or schema first).

#### Code first

In the code first approach, use the `@Directive()` decorator to apply the directive.

```typescript
@Directive('@upper')
@Field()
title: string;
```

> info **Hint** The `@Directive()` decorator is exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package.

Directives can be applied on fields, field resolvers, input and object types, as well as queries, mutations, and subscriptions. Here's an example of the directive applied on the query handler level:

```typescript
@Directive('@deprecated(reason: "This query will be removed in the next version")')
@Query(returns => Author, { name: 'author' })
async getAuthor(@Args({ name: 'id', type: () => Int }) id: number) {
  return this.authorsService.findOneById(id);
}
```

Directives applied through the `@Directive()` decorator will not be reflected in the generated schema definition file.

#### Schema first

In the schema first approach, apply directives directly in SDL.

```graphql
directive @upper on FIELD_DEFINITION

type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String! @upper
  votes: Int
}
```
### Plugins <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/plugins"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="plugins" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Plugins enable you to extend Apollo Server's core functionality by performing custom operations in response to certain events. Currently, these events correspond to individual phases of the GraphQL request lifecycle, and to the startup of Apollo Server itself (read more [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/plugins/)). For example, a basic logging plugin might log the GraphQL query string associated with each request that's sent to Apollo Server.

#### Custom plugins

To create a plugin, declare a class annotated with the `@Plugin` decorator exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package. Also, for better code autocompletion, implement the `ApolloServerPlugin` interface from the `apollo-server-plugin-base` package.

```typescript
import { Plugin } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import {
  ApolloServerPlugin,
  GraphQLRequestListener,
} from 'apollo-server-plugin-base';

@Plugin()
export class LoggingPlugin implements ApolloServerPlugin {
  requestDidStart(): GraphQLRequestListener {
    console.log('Request started');
    return {
      willSendResponse() {
        console.log('Will send response');
      },
    };
  }
}
```

With this in place, we can register the `LoggingPlugin` as a provider.

```typescript
@Module({
  providers: [LoggingPlugin],
})
export class CommonModule {}
```

Nest will automatically instantiate a plugin and apply it to the Apollo Server.

#### Using external plugins

There are several plugins provided out-of-the-box. To use an existing plugin, simply import it and add it to the `plugins` array:

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot({
  // ...
  plugins: [ApolloServerOperationRegistry({ /* options */})]
}),
```

> info **Hint** The `ApolloServerOperationRegistry` plugin is exported from the `apollo-server-plugin-operation-registry` package.
### Interfaces <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/interfaces"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="interfaces" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Like many type systems, GraphQL supports interfaces. An **Interface** is an abstract type that includes a certain set of fields that a type must include to implement the interface (read more [here](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#interfaces)).

#### Code first

When using the code first approach, you define a GraphQL interface by creating an abstract class annotated with the `@InterfaceType()` decorator exported from the `@nestjs/graphql`.

```typescript
import { Field, ID, InterfaceType } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@InterfaceType()
export abstract class Character {
  @Field(type => ID)
  id: string;

  @Field()
  name: string;
}
```

> warning **Warning** TypeScript interfaces cannot be used to define GraphQL interfaces.

This will result in generating the following part of the GraphQL schema in SDL:

```graphql
interface Character {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

Now, to implement the `Character` interface, use the `implements` key:

```typescript
@ObjectType({
  implements: [Character],
})
export class Human implements Character {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}
```

> info **Hint** The `@ObjectType()` decorator is exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package.

The default `resolveType()` function generated by the library extracts the type based on the value returned from the resolver method. This means that you must return class instances (you cannot return literal JavaScript objects).

To provide a customized `resolveType()` function, pass the `resolveType` property to the options object passed into the `@InterfaceType()` decorator, as follows:

```typescript
@InterfaceType({
  resolveType(book) {
    if (book.colors) {
      return ColoringBook;
    }
    return TextBook;
  },
})
export abstract class Book {
  @Field(type => ID)
  id: string;

  @Field()
  title: string;
}
```

#### Schema first

To define an interface in the schema first approach, simply create a GraphQL interface with SDL.

```graphql
interface Character {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

Then, you can use the typings generation feature (as shown in the [quick start](/graphql/quick-start) chapter) to generate corresponding TypeScript definitions:

```typescript
export interface Character {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}
```

Interfaces require an extra `__resolveType` field in the resolver map to determine which type the interface should resolve to. Let's create a `CharactersResolver` class and define the `__resolveType` method:

```typescript
@Resolver('Character')
export class CharactersResolver {
  @ResolveField()
  __resolveType(value) {
    if ('age' in value) {
      return Person;
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** All decorators are exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package.
### Unions <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/unions"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="unions" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Union types are very similar to interfaces, but they don't get to specify any common fields between the types (read more [here](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#union-types)). Unions are useful for returning disjoint data types from a single field.

#### Code first

To define a GraphQL union type, we must define classes that this union will be composed of. Following the [example](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/unions-interfaces/#union-type) from the Apollo documentation, we'll create two classes. First, `Book`:

```typescript
import { Field, ObjectType } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@ObjectType()
export class Book {
  @Field()
  title: string;
}
```

And then `Author`:

```typescript
import { Field, ObjectType } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@ObjectType()
export class Author {
  @Field()
  name: string;
}
```

With this in place, register the `Result` union using the `createUnionType` function exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package:

```typescript
export const ResultUnion = createUnionType({
  name: 'Result',
  types: () => [Author, Book],
});
```

Now, we can reference the `ResultUnion` in our query:

```typescript
@Query(returns => [ResultUnion])
search(): Array<typeof ResultUnion> {
  return [new Author(), new Book()];
}
```

This will result in generating the following part of the GraphQL schema in SDL:

```graphql
type Author {
  name: String!
}

type Book {
  title: String!
}

union ResultUnion = Author | Book

type Query {
  search: [ResultUnion!]!
}
```

The default `resolveType()` function generated by the library will extract the type based on the value returned from the resolver method. That means returning class instances instead of literal JavaScript object is obligatory.

To provide a customized `resolveType()` function, pass the `resolveType` property to the options object passed into the `createUnionType()` function, as follows:

```typescript
export const ResultUnion = createUnionType({
  name: 'Result',
  types: () => [Author, Book],
  resolveType(value) {
    if (value.name) {
      return Author;
    }
    if (value.title) {
      return Book;
    }
    return null;
  },
});
```

#### Schema first

To define a union in the schema first approach, simply create a GraphQL union with SDL.

```graphql
type Author {
  name: String!
}

type Book {
  title: String!
}

union ResultUnion = Author | Book
```

Then, you can use the typings generation feature (as shown in the [quick start](/graphql/quick-start) chapter) to generate corresponding TypeScript definitions:

```typescript
export class Author {
  name: string;
}

export class Book {
  title: string;
}

export type ResultUnion = Author | Book;
```

Unions require an extra `__resolveType` field in the resolver map to determine which type the union should resolve to. Let's create a `ResultUnionResolver` class and define the `__resolveType` method:

```typescript
@Resolver('ResultUnion')
export class ResultUnionResolver {
  @ResolveField()
  __resolveType(value) {
    if (value.name) {
      return 'Author';
    }
    if (value.title) {
      return 'Book';
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** All decorators are exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package.
### Enums <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/enums"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="enums" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Enumeration types are a special kind of scalar that is restricted to a particular set of allowed values (read more [here](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#enumeration-types)). This allows you to:

- validate that any arguments of this type are one of the allowed values
- communicate through the type system that a field will always be one of a finite set of values

#### Code first

When using the code first approach, you define a GraphQL enum type by simply creating a TypeScript enum.

```typescript
export enum AllowedColor {
  RED,
  GREEN,
  BLUE,
}
```

With this in place, register the `AllowedColor` enum using the `registerEnumType` function exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package:

```typescript
registerEnumType(AllowedColor, {
  name: 'AllowedColor',
});
```

Now you can reference the `AllowedColor` in our types:

```typescript
@Field(type => AllowedColor)
favoriteColor: AllowedColor;
```

This will result in generating the following part of the GraphQL schema in SDL:

```graphql
enum AllowedColor {
  RED
  GREEN
  BLUE
}
```

#### Schema first

To define an enumerator in the schema first approach, simply create a GraphQL enum with SDL.

```graphql
enum AllowedColor {
  RED
  GREEN
  BLUE
}
```

Then you can use the typings generation feature (as shown in the [quick start](/graphql/quick-start) chapter) to generate corresponding TypeScript definitions:

```typescript
export enum AllowedColor {
  RED
  GREEN
  BLUE
}
```

Sometimes a backend forces a different value for an enum internally than in the public API. In this example the API contains `RED`, however in resolvers we may use `#f00` instead (read more [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/scalars-enums/#internal-values)). To accomplish this, declare a resolver object for the `AllowedColor` enum:

```typescript
export const allowedColorResolver: Record<keyof typeof AllowedColor, any> = {
  RED: '#f00',
}
```

> info **Hint** All decorators are exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package.

Then use this resolver object together with the `resolvers` property of the `GraphQLModule#forRoot()` method, as follows:

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot({
  resolvers: {
    AllowedColor: allowedColorResolver,
  },
})
```
### Mapped types <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/mapped-types"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="mapped-types" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

> warning **Warning** This chapter applies only to the code first approach.

As you build out features like CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) it's often useful to construct variants on a base entity type. Nest provides several utility functions that perform type transformations to make this task more convenient.

#### Partial

When building input validation types (also called DTOs), it's often useful to build **create** and **update** variations on the same type. For example, the **create** variant may require all fields, while the **update** variant may make all fields optional.

Nest provides the `PartialType()` utility function to make this task easier and minimize boilerplate.

The `PartialType()` function returns a type (class) with all the properties of the input type set to optional. For example, suppose we have a **create** type as follows:

```typescript
@InputType()
class CreateUserInput {
  @Field()
  email: string;

  @Field()
  password: string;

  @Field()
  firstName: string;
}
```

By default, all of these fields are required. To create a type with the same fields, but with each one optional, use `PartialType()` passing the class reference (`CreateUserInput`) as an argument:

```typescript
@InputType()
export class UpdateUserInput extends PartialType(CreateUserInput) {}
```

> info **Hint** The `PartialType()` function is imported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package.

The `PartialType()` function takes an optional second argument that is a reference to a decorator factory.  This argument can be used to change the decorator function applied to the resulting (child) class.  If not specified, the child class effectively uses the same decorator as the **parent** class (the class referenced in the first argument). In the example above, we are extending `CreateUserInput` which is annotated with the `@InputType()` decorator.  Since we want `UpdateUserInput` to also be treated as if it were decorated with `@InputType()`, we didn't need to pass `InputType` as the second argument. If the parent and child types are different, (e.g., the parent is decorated with `@ObjectType`), we would  pass `InputType` as the second argument. For example:

```typescript
@InputType()
export class UpdateUserInput extends PartialType(User, InputType) {}
```

#### Pick

The `PickType()` function constructs a new type (class) by picking a set of properties from an input type. For example, suppose we start with a type like:

```typescript
@InputType()
class CreateUserInput {
  @Field()
  email: string;

  @Field()
  password: string;

  @Field()
  firstName: string;
}
```

We can pick a set of properties from this class using the `PickType()` utility function:

```typescript
@InputType()
export class UpdateEmailInput extends PickType(CreateUserInput, ['email'] as const) {}
```

> info **Hint** The `PickType()` function is imported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package.

#### Omit

The `OmitType()` function constructs a type by picking all properties from an input type and then removing a particular set of keys. For example, suppose we start with a type like:

```typescript
@InputType()
class CreateUserInput {
  @Field()
  email: string;

  @Field()
  password: string;

  @Field()
  firstName: string;
}
```

We can generate a derived type that has every property **except** `email` as shown below. In this construct, the second argument to `OmitType` is an array of property names.

```typescript
@InputType()
export class UpdateUserInput extends OmitType(CreateUserInput, ['email'] as const) {}
```

> info **Hint** The `OmitType()` function is imported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package.

#### Intersection

The `IntersectionType()` function combines two types into one new type (class). For example, suppose we start with two types like:

```typescript
@InputType()
class CreateUserInput {
  @Field()
  email: string;

  @Field()
  password: string;
}

@ObjectType()
export class AdditionalUserInfo {
  @Field()
  firstName: string;

  @Field()
  lastName: string;
}
```

We can generate a new type that combines all properties in both types.

```typescript
@InputType()
export class UpdateUserInput extends IntersectionType(CreateUserInput, AdditionalUserInfo) {}
```

> info **Hint** The `IntersectionType()` function is imported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package.

#### Composition

The type mapping utility functions are composable. For example, the following will produce a type (class) that has all of the properties of the `CreateUserInput` type except for `email`, and those properties will be set to optional:

```typescript
@InputType()
export class UpdateUserInput extends PartialType(
  OmitType(CreateUserInput, ['email'] as const),
) {}
```
### Complexity <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/complexity"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="complexity" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

> warning **Warning** This chapter applies only to the code first approach.

Query complexity allows you to define how complex certain fields are, and to restrict queries with a **maximum complexity**. The idea is to define how complex each field is by using a simple number. A common default is to give each field a complexity of `1`. In addition, the complexity calculation of a GraphQL query can be customized with so-called complexity estimators. A complexity estimator is a simple function that calculates the complexity for a field. You can add any number of complexity estimators to the rule, which are then executed one after another. The first estimator that returns a numeric complexity value determines the complexity for that field.

The `@nestjs/graphql` package integrates very well with tools like [graphql-query-complexity](https://github.com/slicknode/graphql-query-complexity) that provides a cost analysis-based solution. With this library, you can reject queries to your GraphQL server that are deemed too costly to execute.

#### Installation

To begin using it, we first install the required dependency.

```bash
$ npm install --save graphql-query-complexity
```

#### Getting started

Once the installation process is complete, we can define the `ComplexityPlugin` class:

```typescript
import { GraphQLSchemaHost, Plugin } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import {
  ApolloServerPlugin,
  GraphQLRequestListener,
} from 'apollo-server-plugin-base';
import { GraphQLError } from 'graphql';
import {
  fieldExtensionsEstimator,
  getComplexity,
  simpleEstimator,
} from 'graphql-query-complexity';

@Plugin()
export class ComplexityPlugin implements ApolloServerPlugin {
  constructor(private gqlSchemaHost: GraphQLSchemaHost) {}

  requestDidStart(): GraphQLRequestListener {
    const { schema } = this.gqlSchemaHost;

    return {
      didResolveOperation({ request, document }) {
        const complexity = getComplexity({
          schema,
          operationName: request.operationName,
          query: document,
          variables: request.variables,
          estimators: [
            fieldExtensionsEstimator(),
            simpleEstimator({ defaultComplexity: 1 }),
          ],
        });
        if (complexity >= 20) {
          throw new GraphQLError(
            `Query is too complex: ${complexity}. Maximum allowed complexity: 20`,
          );
        }
        console.log('Query Complexity:', complexity);
      },
    };
  }
}
```

For demonstration purposes, we specified the maximum allowed complexity as `20`. In the example above, we used 2 estimators, the `simpleEstimator` and the `fieldExtensionsEstimator`.

- `simpleEstimator`: the simple estimator returns a fixed complexity for each field
- `fieldExtensionsEstimator`: the field extensions estimator extracts the complexity value for each field of your schema

> info **Hint** Remember to add this class to the providers array in any module.

#### Field-level complexity

With this plugin in place, we can now define the complexity for any field by specifying the `complexity` property in the options object passed into the `@Field()` decorator, as follows:

```typescript
@Field({ complexity: 3 })
title: string;
```

Alternatively, you can define the estimator function:

```typescript
@Field({ complexity: (options: ComplexityEstimatorArgs) => ... })
title: string;
```
### Extensions <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/extensions"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="extensions" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

> warning **Warning** This chapter applies only to the code first approach.

Extensions is an **advanced, low-level feature** that lets you define arbitrary data in the types configuration. Attaching custom metadata to certain fields allows you to create more sophisticated, generic solutions. For example, with extensions, you can define field-level roles required to access particular fields. Such roles can be reflected at runtime to determine whether the caller has sufficient permissions to retrieve a specific field.

#### Adding custom metadata

To attach custom metadata for a field, use the `@Extensions()` decorator exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package.

```typescript
@Field()
@Extensions({ role: Role.ADMIN })
password: string;
```

In the example above, we assigned the `role` metadata property the value of `Role.ADMIN`.  `Role` is a simple TypeScript enum that groups all the user roles available in our system.

Note, in addition to setting metadata on fields, you can use the `@Extensions()` decorator at the class level and method level (e.g., on the query handler).

#### Using custom metadata

The logic that leverages the custom metatada can be as complex as needed. For example, you can create a simple interceptor that stores/logs events per method invocation, or create a sophisticated guard that **analyzes requested fields**, iterates through the `GraphQLObjectType` definition, and matches the roles required to retrieve specific fields with the caller permissions (field-level permissions system).

Let's define a `FieldRolesGuard` that implements a basic version of such a field-level permissions system.

```typescript
import { CanActivate, ExecutionContext, Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { GqlExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { GraphQLNonNull, GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLResolveInfo } from 'graphql';
import * as graphqlFields from 'graphql-fields';

@Injectable()
export class FieldRolesGuard implements CanActivate {
  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
    const info = GqlExecutionContext.create(context).getInfo<
      GraphQLResolveInfo
    >();
    const returnType = (info.returnType instanceof GraphQLNonNull
      ? info.returnType.ofType
      : info.returnType) as GraphQLObjectType;

    const fields = returnType.getFields();
    const requestedFields = graphqlFields(info);

    Object.entries(fields)
      .filter(([key]) => key in requestedFields)
      .map(([_, field]) => field)
      .filter((field) => field.extensions && field.extensions.role)
      .forEach((field) => {
        // match user and field roles here
        console.log(field.extensions.role);
      });

    return true;
  }
}
```

> warning **Warning** For illustration purposes, we assumed that **every** resolver returns either the `GraphQLObjectType` or `GraphQLNonNull` that wraps the object type. In a real-world application, you should cover other cases (scalars, etc.). Note that using this particular implementation can lead to unexpected errors (e.g., missing `getFields()` method).

In the example above, we've used the [graphql-fields](https://github.com/robrichard/graphql-fields) package that turns the `GraphQLResolveInfo` object into an object that consists of the requested fields. We used this specific library to make the presented example somewhat simpler.

With this guard in place, if the return type of any resolver contains a field annotated with the `@Extensions({{ '{' }} role: Role.ADMIN {{ '}' }}})` decorator, this `role` (`Role.ADMIN`) will be logged in the console **if requested** in the GraphQL query.
### CLI Plugin <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/cli-plugin"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="cli-plugin-graphql" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

> warning **Warning** This chapter applies only to the code first approach.

TypeScript's metadata reflection system has several limitations which make it impossible to, for instance, determine what properties a class consists of or recognize whether a given property is optional or required. However, some of these constraints can be addressed at compilation time. Nest provides a plugin that enhances the TypeScript compilation process to reduce the amount of boilerplate code required.

> info **Hint** This plugin is **opt-in**. If you prefer, you can declare all decorators manually, or only specific decorators where you need them.

#### Overview

The GraphQL plugin will automatically:

- annotate all input object, object type and args classes properties with `@Field` unless `@HideField` is used
- set the `nullable` property depending on the question mark (e.g. `name?: string` will set `nullable: true`)
- set the `type` property depending on the type (supports arrays as well)

Please, note that your filenames **must have** one of the following suffixes in order to be analyzed by the plugin: `['.input.ts', '.args.ts', '.entity.ts', '.model.ts']` (e.g., `author.entity.ts`). If you are using a different suffix, you can adjust the plugin's behavior by specifying the `typeFileNameSuffix` option (see below).

With what we've learned so far, you have to duplicate a lot of code to let the package know how your type should be declared in GraphQL. For example, you could define a simple `Author` class as follows:

```typescript
@@filename(authors/models/author.model)
@ObjectType()
export class Author {
  @Field(type => Int)
  id: number;

  @Field({ nullable: true })
  firstName?: string;

  @Field({ nullable: true })
  lastName?: string;

  @Field(type => [Post])
  posts: Post[];
}
```

While not a significant issue with medium-sized projects, it becomes verbose & hard to maintain once you have a large set of classes.

By enabling the GraphQL plugin, the above class definition can be declared simply:

```typescript
@@filename(authors/models/author.model)
@ObjectType()
export class Author {
  @Field(type => Int)
  id: number;
  firstName?: string;
  lastName?: string;
  posts: Post[];
}
```

The plugin adds appropriate decorators on-the-fly based on the **Abstract Syntax Tree**. Thus, you won't have to struggle with `@Field` decorators scattered throughout the code.

> info **Hint** The plugin will automatically generate any missing swagger properties, but if you need to override them, simply set them explicitly via `@Field()`.
#### Using the CLI plugin
To enable the plugin, open `nest-cli.json` (if you use [Nest CLI](/cli/overview)) and add the following `plugins` configuration:

```javascript
{
  "collection": "@nestjs/schematics",
  "sourceRoot": "src",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": ["@nestjs/graphql/plugin"]
  }
}
```

You can use the `options` property to customize the behavior of the plugin.

```javascript
"plugins": [
  {
    "name": "@nestjs/graphql/plugin",
    "options": {
      "typeFileNameSuffix": [".input.ts", ".args.ts"]
    }
  }
]
```

The `options` property has to fulfill the following interface:

```typescript
export interface PluginOptions {
  typeFileNameSuffix?: string[];
}
```

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Option</th>
    <th>Default</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>typeFileNameSuffix</code></td>
    <td><code>['.input.ts', '.args.ts', '.entity.ts', '.model.ts']</code></td>
    <td>GraphQL types files suffix</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If you don't use the CLI but instead have a custom `webpack` configuration, you can use this plugin in combination with `ts-loader`:

```javascript
getCustomTransformers: (program: any) => ({
  before: [require('@nestjs/graphql/plugin').before({}, program)]
}),
```
### Generating SDL <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/generating-sdl"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="generating-sdl" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

> warning **Warning** This chapter applies only to the code first approach.

To manually generate a GraphQL SDL schema (i.e., without running an application, connecting to the database, hooking up resolvers, etc.), use the `GraphQLSchemaBuilderModule`.

```typescript
async function generateSchema() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(GraphQLSchemaBuilderModule);
  await app.init();

  const gqlSchemaFactory = app.get(GraphQLSchemaFactory);
  const schema = await gqlSchemaFactory.create([RecipesResolver]);
  console.log(printSchema(schema));
}
```

> info **Hint** The `GraphQLSchemaBuilderModule` and `GraphQLSchemaFactory` are imported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package. The `printSchema` function is imported from the `graphql` package.

#### Usage

The `gqlSchemaFactory.create()` method takes an array of resolver class references. For example:

```typescript
const schema = await gqlSchemaFactory.create([
  RecipesResolver,
  AuthorsResolver,
  PostsResolvers,
]);
```

It also takes a second optional argument with an array of scalar classes:

```typescript
const schema = await gqlSchemaFactory.create(
  [RecipesResolver, AuthorsResolver, PostsResolvers],
  [DurationScalar, DateScalar],
);
```

Lastly, you can pass an options object:

```typescript
const schema = await gqlSchemaFactory.create([RecipesResolver], {
  skipCheck: true,
  orphanedTypes: [],
});
```

- `skipCheck`: ignore schema validation; boolean, defaults to `false`
- `orphanedTypes`: list of classes that are not explicitly referenced (not part of the object graph) to be generated. Normally, if a class is declared but isn't otherwise referenced in the graph, it's omitted. The property value is an array of class references.
### Other features <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/other-features"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="other-features" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

In the GraphQL world, there is a lot of debate about handling issues like **authentication**, or **side-effects** of operations. Should we handle things inside the business logic? Should we use a higher-order function to enhance queries and mutations with authorization logic? Or should we use [schema directives](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/directives/)? There is no single one-size-fits-all answer to these questions.

Nest helps address these issues with its cross-platform features like [guards](/guards) and [interceptors](/interceptors). The philosophy is to reduce redundancy and provide tooling that helps create well-structured, readable, and consistent applications.

#### Overview

You can use standard [guards](/guards), [interceptors](/interceptors), [filters](/exception-filters) and [pipes](/pipes) in the same fashion with GraphQL as with any RESTful application. Additionally, you can easily create your own decorators by leveraging the [custom decorators](/custom-decorators) feature. Let's take a look at a sample GraphQL query handler.

```typescript
@Query('author')
@UseGuards(AuthGuard)
async getAuthor(@Args('id', ParseIntPipe) id: number) {
  return this.authorsService.findOneById(id);
}
```

As you can see, GraphQL works with both guards and pipes in the same way as HTTP REST handlers. Because of this, you can move your authentication logic to a guard; you can even reuse the same guard class across both a REST and GraphQL API interface. Similarly, interceptors work across both types of applications in the same way:

```typescript
@Mutation()
@UseInterceptors(EventsInterceptor)
async upvotePost(@Args('postId') postId: number) {
  return this.postsService.upvoteById({ id: postId });
}
```

#### Execution context

Since GraphQL receives a different type of data in the incoming request, the [execution context](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/execution-context) received by both guards and interceptors is somewhat different with GraphQL vs. REST. GraphQL resolvers have a distinct set of arguments: `root`, `args`, `context`, and `info`. Thus guards and interceptors must transform the generic `ExecutionContext` to a `GqlExecutionContext`. This is straightforward:

```typescript
import { CanActivate, ExecutionContext, Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { GqlExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@Injectable()
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
    const ctx = GqlExecutionContext.create(context);
    return true;
  }
}
```

The GraphQL context object returned by `GqlExecutionContext.create()` exposes a **get** method for each GraphQL resolver argument (e.g., `getArgs()`, `getContext()`, etc). Once transformed, we can easily pick out any GraphQL argument for the current request.

#### Exception filters

Nest standard [exception filters](/exception-filters) are compatible with GraphQL applications as well. As with `ExecutionContext`, GraphQL apps should transform the `ArgumentsHost` object to a `GqlArgumentsHost` object.

```typescript
@Catch(HttpException)
export class HttpExceptionFilter implements GqlExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception: HttpException, host: ArgumentsHost) {
    const gqlHost = GqlArgumentsHost.create(host);
    return exception;
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** Both `GqlExceptionFilter` and `GqlArgumentsHost` are imported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package.

Note that unlike the REST case, you don't use the native `response` object to generate a response.

#### Custom decorators

As mentioned, the [custom decorators](/custom-decorators) feature works as expected with GraphQL resolvers.

```typescript
export const User = createParamDecorator(
  (data: unknown, ctx: ExecutionContext) =>
    GqlExecutionContext.create(ctx).getContext().user,
);
```

Use the `@User()` custom decorator as follows:

```typescript
@Mutation()
async upvotePost(
  @User() user: UserEntity,
  @Args('postId') postId: number,
) {}
```

> info **Hint** In the above example, we have assumed that the `user` object is assigned to the context of your GraphQL application.

#### Execute enhancers at the field resolver level

In the GraphQL context, Nest does not run **enhancers** (the generic name for interceptors, guards and filters) at the field level [see this issue](https://github.com/nestjs/graphql/issues/320#issuecomment-511193229): they only run for the top level `@Query()`/`@Mutation()` method. You can tell Nest to execute interceptors, guards or filters for methods annotated with `@ResolveField()` by setting the `fieldResolverEnhancers` option in `GqlModuleOptions`.  Pass it a list of `'interceptors'`, `'guards'`, and/or `'filters'` as appropriate:

```typescript
GraphQLModule.forRoot({
  fieldResolverEnhancers: ['interceptors']
}),
```

> **Warning** Enabling enhancers for field resolvers can cause performance issues when you are returning lots of records and your field resolver is executed thousands of times. For this reason, when you enable `fieldResolverEnhancers`, we advise you to skip execution of enhancers that are not strictly necessary for your field resolvers. You can do this using the following helper function:

```typescript
export function isResolvingGraphQLField(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
  if (context.getType<GqlContextType>() === 'graphql') {
    const gqlContext = GqlExecutionContext.create(context);
    const info = gqlContext.getInfo();
    const parentType = info.parentType.name;
    return parentType !== 'Query' && parentType !== 'Mutation';
  }
  return false;
}
```
### Federation <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/federation"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="federation" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

[Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/introduction/) offers a means of splitting your monolithic GraphQL server into independent microservices. It consists of two components: a gateway and one or more federated microservices. Each microservice holds part of the schema and the gateway merges the schemas into a single schema that can be consumed by the client.

To quote the [Apollo docs](https://blog.apollographql.com/apollo-federation-f260cf525d21), Federation is designed with these core principles:

- Building a graph should be **declarative.** With federation, you compose a graph declaratively from within your schema instead of writing imperative schema stitching code.
- Code should be separated by **concern**, not by types. Often no single team controls every aspect of an important type like a User or Product, so the definition of these types should be distributed across teams and codebases, rather than centralized.
- The graph should be simple for clients to consume. Together, federated services can form a complete, product-focused graph that accurately reflects how it‚Äôs being consumed on the client.
- It‚Äôs just **GraphQL**, using only spec-compliant features of the language. Any language, not just JavaScript, can implement federation.

> warning **Warning** Apollo Federation currently does not support subscriptions.

In the next example, we'll set up a demo application with a gateway and two federated endpoints: a Users service and a Posts service.

#### Federated example: Users

First install the optional dependency for federation:

```bash
$ npm install --save @apollo/federation
```

The User service has a simple schema. Note the `@key` directive: it tells the Apollo query planner that a particular instance of User can be fetched if you have its `id`. Also note that we extend the `Query` type.

```graphql
type User @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}

extend type Query {
  getUser(id: ID!): User
}
```

Our resolver has one extra method: `resolveReference`. It's called by the Apollo Gateway whenever a related resource requires a User instance. We'll see an example of this in the Posts service later on. Please note the `@ResolveReference` decorator.

```typescript
import { Args, Query, Resolver, ResolveReference } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { UsersService } from './users.service';

@Resolver('User')
export class UsersResolvers {
  constructor(private usersService: UsersService) {}

  @Query()
  getUser(@Args('id') id: string) {
    return this.usersService.findById(id);
  }

  @ResolveReference()
  resolveReference(reference: { __typename: string; id: string }) {
    return this.usersService.findById(reference.id);
  }
}
```

Finally, we hook everything up in a module together with a `GraphQLFederationModule`. This module accepts the same options as the regular `GraphQLModule`.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { GraphQLFederationModule } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { UsersResolvers } from './users.resolvers';

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLFederationModule.forRoot({
      typePaths: ['**/*.graphql'],
    }),
  ],
  providers: [UsersResolvers],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### Federated example: Posts

The Posts service references the User type in its schema by marking it with the `extend` keyword. It also adds one property to the User type. Note the `@key` directive used for matching instances of User, and the `@external` directive indicating that the `id` field is managed elsewhere.

```graphql
type Post @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  body: String!
  user: User
}

extend type User @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
  posts: [Post]
}

extend type Query {
  getPosts: [Post]
}
```

Our resolver has one method of interest here: `getUser`. It returns a reference containing `__typename` and any additional properties your application needs to resolve the reference, in this case only an `id`. The `__typename` is used by the GraphQL Gateway to pinpoint the microservice responsible for the User type and request the instance. The Users service discussed above will be called on the `resolveReference` method.

```typescript
import { Query, Resolver, Parent, ResolveProperty } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { PostsService } from './posts.service';
import { Post } from './posts.interfaces';

@Resolver('Post')
export class PostsResolvers {
  constructor(private postsService: PostsService) {}

  @Query('getPosts')
  getPosts() {
    return this.postsService.findAll();
  }

  @ResolveProperty('user')
  getUser(@Parent() post: Post) {
    return { __typename: 'User', id: post.userId };
  }
}
```

The Posts service has virtually the same module, but is included below for the sake of completeness:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { GraphQLFederationModule } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { PostsResolvers } from './posts.resolvers';

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLFederationModule.forRoot({
      typePaths: ['**/*.graphql'],
    }),
  ],
  providers: [PostsResolvers],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### Federated example: Gateway

First install the optional dependency for the gateway: `npm install --save @apollo/gateway`.

Our gateway only needs a list of endpoints and will auto-discover the schemas from there. The code for our gateway is therefore very short:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { GraphQLGatewayModule } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLGatewayModule.forRoot({
      server: {
        // ... Apollo server options
        cors: true,
      },
      gateway: {
        serviceList: [
          { name: 'users', url: 'http://user-service/graphql' },
          { name: 'posts', url: 'http://post-service/graphql' },
        ],
      },
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> info **Hint** Apollo recommends that you don't rely on the service discovery in a production environment but use their [Graph Manager](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graph-manager/federation/) instead.

#### Sharing context

You can customize the requests between the gateway and federated services using a build service. This allows you to share context about the request. You can easily extend the default `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` and implement one of the hooks. Please refer to [Apollo Docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/apollo-gateway/#remotegraphqldatasource) on `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` for more information about the possibilities.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { GATEWAY_BUILD_SERVICE, GraphQLGatewayModule } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { RemoteGraphQLDataSource } from '@apollo/gateway';
import { decode } from 'jsonwebtoken';

class AuthenticatedDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {

      useFactory: AuthenticatedDataSource => {
        return ({ name, url }) => new AuthenticatedDataSource({ url });
      },
      inject: [AuthenticatedDataSource],

      }),
      imports: [BuildServiceModule],
      inject: [GATEWAY_BUILD_SERVICE],
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### Async configuration

Both the Federation and Gateway modules support asynchronous initialization using the same `forRootAsync` that's documented in [Quick start](/graphql/quick-start#async-configuration).

### Gateways <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/websockets/gateways"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="gateways" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Most of the concepts discussed elsewhere in this documentation, such as dependency injection, decorators, exception filters, pipes, guards and interceptors, apply equally to gateways. Wherever possible, Nest abstracts implementation details so that the same components can run across HTTP-based platforms, WebSockets, and Microservices. This section covers the aspects of Nest that are specific to WebSockets.

In Nest, a gateway is simply a class annotated with `@WebSocketGateway()` decorator. Technically, gateways are platform-agnostic which makes them compatible with any WebSockets library once an adapter is created. There are two WS platforms supported out-of-the-box: [socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io) and [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws). You can choose the one that best suits your needs. Also, you can build your own adapter by following this [guide](/websockets/adapter).

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/Gateways_1.png" /></figure>

> info **Hint** Gateways can be treated as [providers](/providers); this means they can inject dependencies through the class constructor. Also, gateways can be injected by other classes (providers and controllers) as well.

#### Installation

To start building WebSockets-based applications, first install the required package:

```bash
@@filename()
$ npm i --save @nestjs/websockets @nestjs/platform-socket.io
$ npm i --save-dev @types/socket.io
@@switch
$ npm i --save @nestjs/websockets @nestjs/platform-socket.io
```

#### Overview

In general, each gateway is listening on the same port as the **HTTP server**, unless your app is not a web application, or you have changed the port manually. This default behavior can be modified by passing an argument to the `@WebSocketGateway(80)` decorator where `80` is a chosen port number. You can also set a [namespace](https://socket.io/docs/rooms-and-namespaces/) used by the gateway using the following construction:

```typescript
@WebSocketGateway(80, { namespace: 'events' })
```

> warning **Warning** Gateways are not instantiated until they are referenced in the providers array of an existing module.

You can pass any supported [option](https://socket.io/docs/server-api/) to the socket constructor with the second argument to the `@WebSocketGateway()` decorator, as shown below:

```typescript
@WebSocketGateway(81, { transports: ['websocket'] })
```

The gateway is now listening, but we have not yet subscribed to any incoming messages. Let's create a handler that will subscribe to the `events` messages and respond to the user with the exact same data.

```typescript
@@filename(events.gateway)
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(@MessageBody() data: string): string {
  return data;
}
@@switch
@Bind(MessageBody())
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(data) {
  return data;
}
```

> info **Hint** `@SubscribeMessage()` and `@MessageBody()` decorators are imported from `@nestjs/websockets` package.

If you would prefer not to use decorators, the following code is functionally equivalent:

```typescript
@@filename(events.gateway)
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(client: Socket, data: string): string {
  return data;
}
@@switch
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(client, data) {
  return data;
}
```

In the example above, the `handleEvent()` function takes two arguments. The first one is a platform-specific [socket instance](https://socket.io/docs/server-api/#socket), while the second one is the data received from the client. This approach is not recommended though, because it requires mocking the `socket` instance in each unit test.

Once the `events` message is received, the handler sends an acknowledgment with the same data that was sent over the network. In addition, it's possible to emit messages using a library-specific approach, for example, by making use of `client.emit()` method. In order to access a connected socket instance, use `@ConnectedSocket()` decorator.

```typescript
@@filename(events.gateway)
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(
  @MessageBody() data: string,
  @ConnectedSocket() client: Socket,
): string {
  return data;
}
@@switch
@Bind(MessageBody(), ConnectedSocket())
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(data, client) {
  return data;
}
```

> info **Hint** `@ConnectedSocket()` decorator is imported from `@nestjs/websockets` package.

However, in this case, you won't be able to leverage interceptors. If you don't want to respond to the user, you can simple skip the `return` statement (or explicitly return "falsy" value, e.g. `undefined`).

Now when a client emits the message as follows:

```typescript
socket.emit('events', { name: 'Nest' });
```

The `handleEvent()` method will be executed. In order to listen for messages emitted from within the above handler, the client has to attach a corresponding acknowledgment listener:

```typescript
socket.emit('events', { name: 'Nest' }, data => console.log(data));
```

#### Multiple responses

The acknowledgment is dispatched only once. Furthermore, it is not supported by native WebSockets implementation. To solve this limitation, you may return an object which consist of two properties. The `event` which is a name of the emitted event and the `data` that has to be forwarded to the client.

```typescript
@@filename(events.gateway)
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(@MessageBody() data: unknown): WsResponse<unknown> {
  const event = 'events';
  return { event, data };
}
@@switch
@Bind(MessageBody())
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(data) {
  const event = 'events';
  return { event, data };
}
```

> info **Hint** The `WsResponse` interface is imported from `@nestjs/websockets` package.

In order to listen for the incoming response(s), the client has to apply another event listener.

```typescript
socket.on('events', data => console.log(data));
```

#### Asynchronous responses

Message handlers are able to respond either synchronously or **asynchronously**. Hence, `async` methods are supported. A message handler is also able to return an¬†`Observable`, in which case the result values will be emitted until the stream is completed.

```typescript
@@filename(events.gateway)
@SubscribeMessage('events')
onEvent(@MessageBody() data: unknown): Observable<WsResponse<number>> {
  const event = 'events';
  const response = [1, 2, 3];

  return from(response).pipe(
    map(data => ({ event, data })),
  );
}
@@switch
@Bind(MessageBody())
@SubscribeMessage('events')
onEvent(data) {
  const event = 'events';
  const response = [1, 2, 3];

  return from(response).pipe(
    map(data => ({ event, data })),
  );
}
```

In the example above, the message handler will respond **3 times** (with each item from the array).

#### Lifecycle hooks

There are 3 useful lifecycle hooks available. All of them have corresponding interfaces and are described in the following table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>OnGatewayInit</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      Forces to implement the <code>afterInit()</code> method. Takes library-specific server instance as an argument (and
      spreads the rest if required).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>OnGatewayConnection</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      Forces to implement the <code>handleConnection()</code> method. Takes library-specific client socket instance as
      an argument.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>OnGatewayDisconnect</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      Forces to implement the <code>handleDisconnect()</code> method. Takes library-specific client socket instance as
      an argument.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

> info **Hint** Each lifecycle interface is exposed from `@nestjs/websockets` package.

#### Server

Occasionally, you may want to have a direct access to the native, **platform-specific** server instance. The reference to this object is passed as an argument to the `afterInit()` method (`OnGatewayInit` interface). Another option is to use the `@WebSocketServer()` decorator.

```typescript
@WebSocketServer()
server: Server;
```

> warning **Notice** The `@WebSocketServer()` decorator is imported from the `@nestjs/websockets` package.

Nest will automatically assign the server instance to this property once it is ready to use.

<app-banner-enterprise></app-banner-enterprise>

#### Example

A working example is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/02-gateways).
### Exception filters <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/websockets/exception-filters"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="exception-filters-ws" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

The only difference between the HTTP [exception filter](/exception-filters) layer and the corresponding web sockets layer is that instead of throwing `HttpException`, you should use `WsException`.

```typescript
throw new WsException('Invalid credentials.');
```

> info **Hint** The `WsException` class is imported from the `@nestjs/websockets` package.

With the sample above, Nest will handle the thrown exception and emit the `exception` message with the following structure:

```typescript
{
  status: 'error',
  message: 'Invalid credentials.'
}
```

#### Filters

Web sockets exception filters behave equivalently to HTTP exception filters. The following example uses a manually instantiated method-scoped filter. Just as with HTTP based applications, you can also use gateway-scoped filters (i.e., prefix the gateway class with a `@UseFilters()` decorator).

```typescript
@UseFilters(new WsExceptionFilter())
@SubscribeMessage('events')
onEvent(client, data: any): WsResponse<any> {
  const event = 'events';
  return { event, data };
}
```

#### Inheritance

Typically, you'll create fully customized exception filters crafted to fulfill your application requirements. However, there might be use-cases when you would like to simply extend the **core exception filter**, and override the behavior based on certain factors.

In order to delegate exception processing to the base filter, you need to extend `BaseWsExceptionFilter` and call the inherited `catch()` method.

```typescript
@@filename()
import { Catch, ArgumentsHost } from '@nestjs/common';
import { BaseWsExceptionFilter } from '@nestjs/websockets';

@Catch()
export class AllExceptionsFilter extends BaseWsExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception: unknown, host: ArgumentsHost) {
    super.catch(exception, host);
  }
}
@@switch
import { Catch } from '@nestjs/common';
import { BaseWsExceptionFilter } from '@nestjs/websockets';

@Catch()
export class AllExceptionsFilter extends BaseWsExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception, host) {
    super.catch(exception, host);
  }
}
```

The above implementation is just a shell demonstrating the approach. Your implementation of the extended exception filter would include your tailored **business logic** (e.g., handling various conditions).
### Pipes <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/websockets/pipes"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="pipes-ws" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

There is no fundamental difference between [regular pipes](/pipes) and microservice pipes. The only difference is that instead of throwing `HttpException`, you should use `WsException`. In addition, all pipes will be only applied to the `data` parameter (because validating or transforming `client` instance is useless).

> info **Hint** The `WsException` class is exposed from `@nestjs/websockets` package.

#### Binding pipes

The following example uses a manually instantiated method-scoped pipe. Just as with HTTP based applications, you can also use gateway-scoped pipes (i.e., prefix the gateway class with a `@UsePipes()` decorator).

```typescript
@@filename()
@UsePipes(new ValidationPipe())
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(client: Client, data: unknown): WsResponse<unknown> {
  const event = 'events';
  return { event, data };
}
@@switch
@UsePipes(new ValidationPipe())
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(client, data) {
  const event = 'events';
  return { event, data };
}
```
### Guards <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/websockets/guards"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="guards-ws" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

There is no fundamental difference between web sockets guards and [regular HTTP application guards](/guards). The only difference is that instead of throwing `HttpException`, you should use `WsException`.

> info **Hint** The `WsException` class is exposed from `@nestjs/websockets` package.

#### Binding guards

The following example uses a method-scoped guard. Just as with HTTP based applications, you can also use gateway-scoped guards (i.e., prefix the gateway class with a `@UseGuards()` decorator).

```typescript
@@filename()
@UseGuards(AuthGuard)
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(client: Client, data: unknown): WsResponse<unknown> {
  const event = 'events';
  return { event, data };
}
@@switch
@UseGuards(AuthGuard)
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(client, data) {
  const event = 'events';
  return { event, data };
}
```
### Interceptors <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/websockets/interceptors"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="interceptors-ws" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

There is no difference between [regular interceptors](/interceptors) and web sockets interceptors. The following example uses a manually instantiated method-scoped interceptor. Just as with HTTP based applications, you can also use gateway-scoped interceptors (i.e., prefix the gateway class with a `@UseInterceptors()` decorator).

```typescript
@@filename()
@UseInterceptors(new TransformInterceptor())
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(client: Client, data: unknown): WsResponse<unknown> {
  const event = 'events';
  return { event, data };
}
@@switch
@UseInterceptors(new TransformInterceptor())
@SubscribeMessage('events')
handleEvent(client, data) {
  const event = 'events';
  return { event, data };
}
```
### Adapters <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/websockets/adapter"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="adapter" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

The WebSockets module is platform-agnostic, hence, you can bring your own library (or even a native implementation) by making use of `WebSocketAdapter` interface. This interface forces to implement few methods described in the following table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>create</code></td>
    <td>Creates a socket instance based on passed arguments</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bindClientConnect</code></td>
    <td>Binds the client connection event</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bindClientDisconnect</code></td>
    <td>Binds the client disconnection event (optional*)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>bindMessageHandlers</code></td>
    <td>Binds the incoming message to the corresponding message handler</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>close</code></td>
    <td>Terminates a server instance</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Extend socket.io

The [socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io) package is wrapped in an `IoAdapter` class. What if you would like to enhance the basic functionality of the adapter? For instance, your technical requirements require a capability to broadcast events across multiple load-balanced instances of your web service. For this, you can extend `IoAdapter` and override a single method which responsibility is to instantiate new socket.io servers. But first of all, let's install the required package.

```bash
$ npm i --save socket.io-redis
```

Once the package is installed, we can create a `RedisIoAdapter` class.

```typescript
import { IoAdapter } from '@nestjs/platform-socket.io';
import * as redisIoAdapter from 'socket.io-redis';

export class RedisIoAdapter extends IoAdapter {
  createIOServer(port: number, options?: any): any {
    const server = super.createIOServer(port, options);
    const redisAdapter = redisIoAdapter({ host: 'localhost', port: 6379 });

    server.adapter(redisAdapter);
    return server;
  }
}
```

Afterward, simply switch to your newly created Redis adapter.

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule);
app.useWebSocketAdapter(new RedisIoAdapter(app));
```

#### Ws library

Another available adapter is a `WsAdapter` which in turn acts like a proxy between the framework and integrate blazing fast and thoroughly tested [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) library. This adapter is fully compatible with native browser WebSockets and is far faster than socket.io package. Unluckily, it has significantly fewer functionalities available out-of-the-box. In some cases, you may just don't necessarily need them though.

In order to use `ws`, we firstly have to install the required package:

```bash
$ npm i --save @nestjs/platform-ws
```

Once the package is installed, we can switch an adapter:

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule);
app.useWebSocketAdapter(new WsAdapter(app));
```

> info **Hint** The `WsAdapter` is imported from `@nestjs/platform-ws`.

#### Advanced (custom adapter)

For demonstration purposes, we are going to integrate the [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) library manually. As mentioned, the adapter for this library is already created and is exposed from the `@nestjs/platform-ws` package as a `WsAdapter` class. Here is how the simplified implementation could potentially look like:

```typescript
@@filename(ws-adapter)
import * as WebSocket from 'ws';
import { WebSocketAdapter, INestApplicationContext } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MessageMappingProperties } from '@nestjs/websockets';
import { Observable, fromEvent, EMPTY } from 'rxjs';
import { mergeMap, filter } from 'rxjs/operators';

export class WsAdapter implements WebSocketAdapter {
  constructor(private app: INestApplicationContext) {}

  create(port: number, options: any = {}): any {
    return new ws.Server({ port, ...options });
  }

  bindClientConnect(server, callback: Function) {
    server.on('connection', callback);
  }

  bindMessageHandlers(
    client: WebSocket,
    handlers: MessageMappingProperties[],
    process: (data: any) => Observable<any>,
  ) {
    fromEvent(client, 'message')
      .pipe(
        mergeMap(data => this.bindMessageHandler(data, handlers, process)),
        filter(result => result),
      )
      .subscribe(response => client.send(JSON.stringify(response)));
  }

  bindMessageHandler(
    buffer,
    handlers: MessageMappingProperties[],
    process: (data: any) => Observable<any>,
  ): Observable<any> {
    const message = JSON.parse(buffer.data);
    const messageHandler = handlers.find(
      handler => handler.message === message.event,
    );
    if (!messageHandler) {
      return EMPTY;
    }
    return process(messageHandler.callback(message.data));
  }

  close(server) {
    server.close();
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** When you want to take advantage of [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) library, use built-in `WsAdapter` instead of creating your own one.

Then, we can set up a custom adapter using `useWebSocketAdapter()` method:

```typescript
@@filename(main)
const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule);
app.useWebSocketAdapter(new WsAdapter(app));
```

#### Example

A working example that uses `WsAdapter` is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/16-gateways-ws).

### Overview <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="basics" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

In addition to traditional (sometimes called monolithic) application architectures, Nest natively supports the microservice architectural style of development. Most of the concepts discussed elsewhere in this documentation, such as dependency injection, decorators, exception filters, pipes, guards and interceptors, apply equally to microservices. Wherever possible, Nest abstracts implementation details so that the same components can run across HTTP-based platforms, WebSockets, and Microservices. This section covers the aspects of Nest that are specific to microservices.

In Nest, a microservice is fundamentally an application that uses a different **transport** layer than HTTP.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/Microservices_1.png" /></figure>

Nest supports several built-in transport layer implementations, called **transporters**, which are responsible for transmitting messages between different microservice instances. Most transporters natively support both **request-response** and **event-based** message styles. Nest abstracts the implementation details of each transporter behind a canonical interface for both request-response and event-based messaging. This makes it easy to switch from one transport layer to another -- for example to leverage the specific reliability or performance features of a particular transport layer -- without impacting your application code.

#### Installation

To start building microservices, first install the required package:

```bash
$ npm i --save @nestjs/microservices
```

#### Getting started

To instantiate a microservice, use the `createMicroservice()` method of the `NestFactory` class:

```typescript
@@filename(main)
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { Transport, MicroserviceOptions } from '@nestjs/microservices';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(
    AppModule,
    {
      transport: Transport.TCP,
    },
  );
  app.listen(() => console.log('Microservice is listening'));
}
bootstrap();
@@switch
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { Transport, MicroserviceOptions } from '@nestjs/microservices';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice(AppModule, {
    transport: Transport.TCP,
  });
  app.listen(() => console.log('Microservice is listening'));
}
bootstrap();
```

> info **Hint** Microservices use the **TCP** transport layer by default.

The second argument of the `createMicroservice()` method is an `options` object. This object may consist of two members:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>transport</code></td>
    <td>Specifies the transporter (for example, <code>Transport.NATS</code>)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>options</code></td>
    <td>A transporter-specific options object that determines transporter behavior</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  The <code>options</code> object is specific to the chosen transporter. The <strong>TCP</strong> transporter exposes
  the properties described below.  For other transporters (e.g, Redis, MQTT, etc.), see the relevant chapter for a description of the available options.
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>host</code></td>
    <td>Connection hostname</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>port</code></td>
    <td>Connection port</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>retryAttempts</code></td>
    <td>Number of times to retry message (default: <code>0</code>)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>retryDelay</code></td>
    <td>Delay between message retry attempts (ms) (default: <code>0</code>)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Patterns

Microservices recognize both messages and events by **patterns**. A pattern is a plain value, for example, a literal object or a string. Patterns are automatically serialized and sent over the network along with the data portion of a message. In this way, message senders and consumers can coordinate which requests are consumed by which handlers.

#### Request-response

The request-response message style is useful when you need to **exchange** messages between various external services. With this paradigm, you can be certain that the service has actually received the message (without the need to manually implement a message ACK protocol). However, the request-response paradigm is not always the best choice. For example, streaming transporters that use log-based persistence, such as [Kafka](https://docs.confluent.io/3.0.0/streams/) or [NATS streaming](https://github.com/nats-io/node-nats-streaming), are optimized for solving a different range of issues, more aligned with an event messaging paradigm (see [event-based messaging](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics#event-based) below for more details).

To enable the request-response message type, Nest creates two logical channels - one is responsible for transferring the data while the other waits for incoming responses. For some underlying transports, such as [NATS](https://nats.io/), this dual-channel support is provided out-of-the-box. For others, Nest compensates by manually creating separate channels. There can be overhead for this, so if you do not require a request-response message style, you should consider using the event-based method.

To create a message handler based on the request-response paradigm use the `@MessagePattern()` decorator, which is imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

```typescript
@@filename(math.controller)
import { Controller } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MessagePattern } from '@nestjs/microservices';

@Controller()
export class MathController {
  @MessagePattern({ cmd: 'sum' })
  accumulate(data: number[]): number {
    return (data || []).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
  }
}
@@switch
import { Controller } from '@nestjs/common';
import { MessagePattern } from '@nestjs/microservices';

@Controller()
export class MathController {
  @MessagePattern({ cmd: 'sum' })
  accumulate(data) {
    return (data || []).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
  }
}
```

In the above code, the `accumulate()` **message handler** listens for messages that fulfill the `{{ '{' }} cmd: 'sum' {{ '}' }}` message pattern. The message handler takes a single argument, the `data` passed from the client. In this case, the data is an array of numbers which are to be accumulated.

#### Asynchronous responses

Message handlers are able to respond either synchronously or **asynchronously**. Hence, `async` methods are supported.

```typescript
@@filename()
@MessagePattern({ cmd: 'sum' })
async accumulate(data: number[]): Promise<number> {
  return (data || []).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}
@@switch
@MessagePattern({ cmd: 'sum' })
async accumulate(data) {
  return (data || []).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}
```

A message handler is also able to return an¬†`Observable`, in which case the result values will be emitted until the stream is completed.

```typescript
@@filename()
@MessagePattern({ cmd: 'sum' })
accumulate(data: number[]): Observable<number> {
  return from([1, 2, 3]);
}
@@switch
@MessagePattern({ cmd: 'sum' })
accumulate(data: number[]): Observable<number> {
  return from([1, 2, 3]);
}
```

In the example above, the message handler will respond **3 times** (with each item from the array).

#### Event-based

While the request-response method is ideal for exchanging messages between services, it is less suitable when your message style is event-based - when you just want to publish **events** without waiting for a response. In that case, you do not want the overhead required by request-response for maintaining two channels.

Suppose you would like to simply notify another service that a certain condition has occurred in this part of the system. This is the ideal use case for the event-based message style.

To create an event handler, we use the `@EventPattern()` decorator, which is imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

```typescript
@@filename()
@EventPattern('user_created')
async handleUserCreated(data: Record<string, unknown>) {
  // business logic
}
@@switch
@EventPattern('user_created')
async handleUserCreated(data) {
  // business logic
}
```

The `handleUserCreated()` **event handler** listens for the `'user_created'` event. The event handler takes a single argument, the `data` passed from the client (in this case, an event payload which has been sent over the network).

#### Decorators

In more sophisticated scenarios, you may want to access more information about the incoming request. For example, in the case of NATS with wildcard subscriptions, you may want to get the original subject that the producer has sent the message to. Likewise, in Kafka you may want to access the message headers. In order to accomplish that, you can use built-in decorators as follows:

```typescript
@@filename()
@MessagePattern('time.us.*')
getDate(@Payload() data: number[], @Ctx() context: NatsContext) {
  console.log(`Subject: ${context.getSubject()}`); // e.g. "time.us.east"
  return new Date().toLocaleTimeString(...);
}
@@switch
@Bind(Payload(), Ctx())
@MessagePattern('time.us.*')
getDate(data, context) {
  console.log(`Subject: ${context.getSubject()}`); // e.g. "time.us.east"
  return new Date().toLocaleTimeString(...);
}
```

> info **Hint** `@Payload()`, `@Ctx()` and `NatsContext` are imported from `@nestjs/microservices`.

#### Client

A client Nest application can exchange messages or publish events to a Nest microservice using the `ClientProxy` class. This class defines several methods, such as `send()` (for request-response messaging) and `emit()` (for event-driven messaging) that let you communicate with a remote microservice. Obtain an instance of this class in one of the following ways.

One technique is to import the `ClientsModule`, which exposes the static `register()` method. This method takes an argument which is an array of objects representing microservice transporters. Each such object has a `name` property, an optional `transport` property (default is `Transport.TCP`), and an optional transporter-specific `options` property.

The `name` property serves as an **injection token** that can be used to inject an instance of a `ClientProxy` where needed. The value of the `name` property, as an injection token, can be an arbitrary string or JavaScript symbol, as described [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/custom-providers#non-class-based-provider-tokens).

The `options` property is an object with the same properties we saw in the `createMicroservice()` method earlier.

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [
    ClientsModule.register([
      { name: 'MATH_SERVICE', transport: Transport.TCP },
    ]),
  ]
  ...
})
```

Once the module has been imported, we can inject an instance of the `ClientProxy` configured as specified via the `'MATH_SERVICE'` transporter options shown above, using the `@Inject()` decorator.

```typescript
constructor(
  @Inject('MATH_SERVICE') private client: ClientProxy,
) {}
```

> info **Hint** The `ClientsModule` and `ClientProxy` classes are imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

At times we may need to fetch the transporter configuration from another service (say a `ConfigService`), rather than hard-coding it in our client application. To do this, we can register a [custom provider](/techniques/custom-providers) using the `ClientProxyFactory` class. This class has a static `create()` method, which accepts a transporter options object, and returns a customized `ClientProxy` instance.

```typescript
@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: 'MATH_SERVICE',
      useFactory: (configService: ConfigService) => {
        const mathSvcOptions = configService.getMathSvcOptions();
        return ClientProxyFactory.create(mathSvcOptions);
      },
      inject: [ConfigService],
    }
  ]
  ...
})
```

> info **Hint** The `ClientProxyFactory` is imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

Another option is to use the `@Client()` property decorator.

```typescript
@Client({ transport: Transport.TCP })
client: ClientProxy;
```

> info **Hint** The `@Client()` decorator is imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

Using the `@Client()` decorator is not the preferred technique, as it is harder to test and harder to share a client instance.

The `ClientProxy` is **lazy**. It doesn't initiate a connection immediately. Instead, it will be established before the first microservice call, and then reused across each subsequent call. However, if you want to delay the application bootstrapping process until a connection is established, you can manually initiate a connection using the `ClientProxy` object's `connect()` method inside the `OnApplicationBootstrap` lifecycle hook.

```typescript
@@filename()
async onApplicationBootstrap() {
  await this.client.connect();
}
```

If the connection cannot be created, the `connect()` method will reject with the corresponding error object.

#### Sending messages

The `ClientProxy` exposes a `send()` method. This method is intended to call the microservice and returns an `Observable` with its response. Thus, we can subscribe to the emitted values easily.

```typescript
@@filename()
accumulate(): Observable<number> {
  const pattern = { cmd: 'sum' };
  const payload = [1, 2, 3];
  return this.client.send<number>(pattern, payload);
}
@@switch
accumulate() {
  const pattern = { cmd: 'sum' };
  const payload = [1, 2, 3];
  return this.client.send(pattern, payload);
}
```

The `send()` method takes two arguments, `pattern` and `payload`. The `pattern` should match one defined in a `@MessagePattern()` decorator. The `payload` is a message that we want to transmit to the remote microservice. This method returns a **cold `Observable`**, which means that you have to explicitly subscribe to it before the message will be sent.

#### Publishing events

To send an event, use the `ClientProxy` object's `emit()` method. This method publishes an event to the message broker.

```typescript
@@filename()
async publish() {
  this.client.emit<number>('user_created', new UserCreatedEvent());
}
@@switch
async publish() {
  this.client.emit('user_created', new UserCreatedEvent());
}
```

The `emit()` method takes two arguments, `pattern` and `payload`. The `pattern`should match one defined in an `@EventPattern()` decorator. The `payload` is an event payload that we want to transmit to the remote microservice. This method returns a **hot `Observable`** (unlike the cold `Observable` returned by `send()`), which means that whether or not you explicitly subscribe to the observable, the proxy will immediately try to deliver the event.

#### Scopes

For people coming from different programming language backgrounds, it might be unexpected to learn that in Nest, almost everything is shared across incoming requests. We have a connection pool to the database, singleton services with global state, etc. Remember that Node.js doesn't follow the request/response Multi-Threaded Stateless Model in which every request is processed by a separate thread. Hence, using singleton instances is fully **safe** for our applications.

However, there are edge-cases when request-based lifetime of the handler may be the desired behavior, for instance per-request caching in GraphQL applications, request tracking or multi-tenancy. Learn how to control scopes [here](/fundamentals/injection-scopes).

Request-scoped handlers and providers can inject `RequestContext` using the `@Inject()` decorator in combination with `CONTEXT` token:

```typescript
import { Injectable, Scope, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CONTEXT, RequestContext } from '@nestjs/microservices';

@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST })
export class CatsService {
  constructor(@Inject(CONTEXT) private ctx: RequestContext) {}
}
```

This provides access to the `RequestContext` object, which has two properties:

```typescript
export interface RequestContext<T = any> {
  pattern: string | Record<string, any>;
  data: T;
}
```

The `data` property is the message payload sent by the message producer. The `pattern` property is the pattern used to identify an appropriate handler to handle the incoming message.
### Redis <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/redis"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="redis" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

The [Redis](https://redis.io/) transporter implements the publish/subscribe messaging paradigm and leverages the [Pub/Sub](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub) feature of Redis. Published messages are categorized in channels, without knowing what subscribers (if any) will eventually receive the message. Each microservice can subscribe to any number of channels. In addition, more than one channel can be subscribed to at a time. Messages exchanged through channels are **fire-and-forget**, which means that if a message is published and there are no subscribers interested in it, the message is removed and cannot be recovered. Thus, you don't have a guarantee that either messages or events will be handled by at least one service. A single message can be subscribed to (and received) by multiple subscribers.

#### Installation

To start building Redis-based microservices, first install the required package:

```bash
$ npm i --save redis
```

#### Overview

To use the Redis transporter, pass the following options object to the `createMicroservice()` method:

```typescript
@@filename(main)
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(ApplicationModule, {
  transport: Transport.REDIS,
  options: {

});
```

> info **Hint** The `Transport` enum is imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

#### Options

The `options` property is specific to the chosen transporter. The <strong>Redis</strong> transporter exposes the properties described below.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>url</code></td>
    <td>Connection url</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>retryAttempts</code></td>
    <td>Number of times to retry message (default: <code>0</code>)</td>
  </tr>

### MQTT <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/mqtt"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="mqtt" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

[MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is an open source, lightweight messaging protocol, optimized for high-latency. This protocol provides a scalable and cost-efficient way to connect devices using a **publish/subscribe** model. A communication system built on MQTT consists of the publishing server, a broker and one or more clients. It is designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks.

#### Installation

To start building MQTT-based microservices, first install the required package:

```bash
$ npm i --save mqtt
```

#### Overview

To use the MQTT transporter, pass the following options object to the `createMicroservice()` method:

```typescript
@@filename(main)
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(ApplicationModule, {
  transport: Transport.MQTT,
  options: {

#### Wildcards

A subscription may be to an explicit topic, or it may include wildcards. Two wildcards are available, `+` and `#`. `+` is a single-level wildcard, while `#` is a multi-level wildcard which covers many topic levels.

```typescript
@@filename()

### NATS <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/nats"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="nats" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

[NATS](https://nats.io) is a simple, secure and high performance open source messaging system for cloud native applications, IoT messaging, and microservices architectures. The NATS server is written in the Go programming language, but client libraries to interact with the server are available for dozens of major programming languages. NATS supports both **At Most Once** and **At Least Once** delivery. It can run anywhere, from large servers and cloud instances, through edge gateways and even Internet of Things devices.

#### Installation

To start building NATS-based microservices, first install the required package:

```bash
$ npm i --save nats
```

#### Overview

To use the NATS transporter, pass the following options object to the `createMicroservice()` method:

```typescript

#### Options

The `options` object is specific to the chosen transporter. The <strong>NATS</strong> transporter exposes the properties described [here](https://github.com/nats-io/node-nats#connect-options).
Additionally, there is a `queue` property which allows you to specify the name of the queue that your server should subscribe to (leave `undefined` to ignore this setting). Read more about NATS queue groups <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/nats#queue-groups">below</a>.

#### Client

Like other microservice transporters, you have <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics#client">several options</a> for creating a NATS `ClientProxy` instance.

Other options to create a client (either `ClientProxyFactory` or `@Client()`) can be used as well. You can read about them <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics#client">here</a>.

#### Request-response

For the **request-response** message style ([read more](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics#request-response)), the NATS transporter uses NATS built-in [Request-Reply](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/reqreply) mechanism. A request is published on a given subject with a reply subject, and responders listen on that subject and send responses to the reply subject. Reply subjects are usually a subject called an `_INBOX` that will be directed back to the requestor dynamically, regardless of location of either party.

#### Event-based

For the **event-based** message style ([read more](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics#event-based)), the NATS transporter uses NATS built-in [Publish-Subscribe](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/pubsub) mechanism. A publisher sends a message on a subject and any active subscriber listening on that subject receives the message. Subscribers can also register interest in wildcard subjects that work a bit like a regular expression. This one-to-many pattern is sometimes called fan-out.

#### Queue groups

NATS provides a built-in load balancing feature called [distributed queues](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/queue). To create a queue subscription, use the `queue` property as follows:

```typescript
@@filename(main)
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice(ApplicationModule, {
  transport: Transport.NATS,
  options: {
    url: 'nats://localhost:4222',
    queue: 'cats_queue',
  },
});
```

#### Context

In more sophisticated scenarios, you may want to access more information about the incoming request. When using the NATS transporter, you can access the `NatsContext` object.

### RabbitMQ <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/rabbitmq"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="rabbitmq" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) is an open-source and lightweight message broker which supports multiple messaging protocols. It can be deployed in distributed and federated configurations to meet high-scale, high-availability requirements.

> info **Hint** `@Payload()`, `@Ctx()` and `RmqContext` are imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

To access the original RabbitMQ message (with the `properties`, `fields`, and `content`), use the `getMessage()` method of the `RmqContext` object, as follows:

```typescript
@@filename()
@MessagePattern('notifications')
getNotifications(@Payload() data: number[], @Ctx() context: RmqContext) {
  console.log(context.getMessage());
}
@@switch
@Bind(Payload(), Ctx())
@MessagePattern('notifications')
getNotifications(data, context) {
  console.log(context.getMessage());
}
```

To retrieve a reference to the RabbitMQ [channel](https://www.rabbitmq.com/channels.html), use the `getChannelRef` method of the `RmqContext` object, as follows:

```typescript
@@filename()
@MessagePattern('notifications')
getNotifications(@Payload() data: number[], @Ctx() context: RmqContext) {
  console.log(context.getChannelRef());
}
@@switch
@Bind(Payload(), Ctx())
@MessagePattern('notifications')
getNotifications(data, context) {
  console.log(context.getChannelRef());
}
```

#### Message acknowledgement

To make sure a message is never lost, RabbitMQ supports [message acknowledgements](https://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html). An acknowledgement is sent back by the consumer to tell RabbitMQ that a particular message has been received, processed and that RabbitMQ is free to delete it. If a consumer dies (its channel is closed, connection is closed, or TCP connection is lost) without sending an ack, RabbitMQ will understand that a message wasn't processed fully and will re-queue it.

To enable manual acknowledgment mode, set the `noAck` property to `false`:

```typescript
options: {
  urls: ['amqp://localhost:5672'],
  queue: 'cats_queue',
  noAck: false,
  queueOptions: {
    durable: false
  },
},
```

When manual consumer acknowledgements are turned on, we must send a proper acknowledgement from the worker to signal that we are done with a task.

```typescript
@@filename()
@MessagePattern('notifications')
getNotifications(@Payload() data: number[], @Ctx() context: RmqContext) {
  const channel = context.getChannelRef();
  const originalMsg = context.getMessage();

  channel.ack(originalMsg);
}
@@switch
@Bind(Payload(), Ctx())
@MessagePattern('notifications')
getNotifications(data, context) {
  const channel = context.getChannelRef();
  const originalMsg = context.getMessage();

  channel.ack(originalMsg);
}
```
### Kafka <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/kafka"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="kafka" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

[Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is an open source, distributed streaming platform which has three key capabilities:

- Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
- Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
- Process streams of records as they occur.

The Kafka project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. It integrates very well with Apache Storm and Spark for real-time streaming data analysis.

**Kafka transporter is experimental.**

#### Installation

To start building Kafka-based microservices, first install the required package:

```bash
$ npm i --save kafkajs
```

#### Overview

Like other Nest microservice transport layer implementations, you select the Kafka transporter mechanism using the `transport` property of the options object passed to the `createMicroservice()` method, along with an optional `options` property, as shown below:

```typescript
@@filename(main)
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(ApplicationModule, {
  transport: Transport.KAFKA,
  options: {
    client: {
      brokers: ['localhost:9092'],
    }
  }
});
@@switch
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice(ApplicationModule, {
  transport: Transport.KAFKA,
  options: {
    client: {
      brokers: ['localhost:9092'],
    }
  }
});
```

> info **Hint** The `Transport` enum is imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

#### Options

The `options` property is specific to the chosen transporter. The <strong>Kafka</strong> transporter exposes the properties described below.

#### Client

There is a small difference in Kafka compared to other microservice transporters. Instead of the `ClientProxy` class, we use the `ClientKafka` class.

Like other microservice transporters, you have <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics#client">several options</a> for creating a `ClientKafka` instance.

One method for creating an instance is to use use the `ClientsModule`. To create a client instance with the `ClientsModule`, import it and use the `register()` method to pass an options object with the same properties shown above in the `createMicroservice()` method, as well as a `name` property to be used as the injection token. Read more about `ClientsModule` <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics#client">here</a>.

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [
    ClientsModule.register([
      {
        name: 'HERO_SERVICE',
        transport: Transport.KAFKA,
        options: {
          client: {
            clientId: 'hero',
            brokers: ['localhost:9092'],
          },
          consumer: {
            groupId: 'hero-consumer'
          }
        }
      },
    ]),
  ]
  ...
})
```

Other options to create a client (either `ClientProxyFactory` or `@Client()`) can be used as well. You can read about them <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics#client">here</a>.

Use the `@Client()` decorator as follows:

```typescript
@Client({
  transport: Transport.KAFKA,
  options: {
    client: {
      clientId: 'hero',
      brokers: ['localhost:9092'],
    },
    consumer: {
      groupId: 'hero-consumer'
    }
  }
})
client: ClientKafka;
```

#### Message response subscription

The `ClientKafka` class provides the `subscribeToResponseOf()` method. The `subscribeToResponseOf()` method takes a request's topic name as an argument and adds the derived reply topic name to a collection of reply topics. This method is required when implementing the message pattern.

```typescript
@@filename(heroes.controller)
onModuleInit() {
  this.client.subscribeToResponseOf('hero.kill.dragon');
}
```

If the `ClientKafka` instance is created asynchronously, the `subscribeToResponseOf()` method must be called before calling the `connect()` method.

```typescript
@@filename(heroes.controller)
async onModuleInit() {
  this.client.subscribeToResponseOf('hero.kill.dragon');
  await this.client.connect();
}
```

#### Message pattern

The Kafka microservice message pattern utilizes two topics for the request and reply channels. The `ClientKafka#send()` method sends messages with a [return address](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/ReturnAddress.html) by associating a [correlation id](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/CorrelationIdentifier.html), reply topic, and reply partition with the request message. This requires the `ClientKafka` instance to be subscribed to the reply topic and assigned to at least one partition before sending a message.

Subsequently, you need to have at least one reply topic partition for every Nest application running. For example, if you are running 4 Nest applications but the reply topic only has 3 partitions, then 1 of the Nest applications will error out when trying to send a message.

When new `ClientKafka` instances are launched they join the consumer group and subscribe to their respective topics. This process triggers a rebalance of topic partitions assigned to consumers of the consumer group.

Normally, topic partitions are assigned using the round robin partitioner, which assigns topic partitions to a collection of consumers sorted by consumer names which are randomly set on application launch. However, when a new consumer joins the consumer group, the new consumer can be positioned anywhere within the collection of consumers. This creates a condition where pre-existing consumers can be assigned different partitions when the pre-existing consumer is positioned after the new consumer. As a result, the consumers that are assigned different partitions will lose response messages of requests sent before the rebalance.

To prevent the `ClientKafka` consumers from losing response messages, a Nest-specific built-in custom partitioner is utilized. This custom partitioner assigns partitions to a collection of consumers sorted by high-resolution timestamps (`process.hrtime()`) that are set on application launch.

#### Incoming

Nest receives incoming Kafka messages as an object with `key`, `value`, and `headers` properties that have values of type `Buffer`. Nest then parses these values by transforming the buffers into strings. If the string is "object like", Nest attempts to parse the string as `JSON`. The `value` is then passed to its associated handler.

#### Outgoing

Nest sends outgoing Kafka messages after a serialization process when publishing events or sending messages. This occurs on arguments passed to the `ClientKafka` `emit()` and `send()` methods or on values returned from a `@MessagePattern` method. This serialization "stringifies" objects that are not strings or buffers by using `JSON.stringify()` or the `toString()` prototype method.

```typescript
@@filename(heroes.controller)
@Controller()
export class HeroesController {
  @MessagePattern('hero.kill.dragon')
  killDragon(@Payload() message: KillDragonMessage): any {
    const dragonId = message.dragonId;
    const items = [
      { id: 1, name: 'Mythical Sword' },
      { id: 2, name: 'Key to Dungeon' },
    ];
    return items;
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** `@Payload()` is imported from the `@nestjs/microservices`.

Outgoing messages can also be keyed by passing an object with the `key` and `value` properties. Keying messages is important for meeting the [co-partitioning requirement](https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/developer-guide/partition-data.html#co-partitioning-requirements).

```typescript
@@filename(heroes.controller)
@Controller()
export class HeroesController {
  @MessagePattern('hero.kill.dragon')
  killDragon(@Payload() message: KillDragonMessage): any {
    const realm = 'Nest';
    const heroId = message.heroId;
    const dragonId = message.dragonId;

    const items = [
      { id: 1, name: 'Mythical Sword' },
      { id: 2, name: 'Key to Dungeon' },
    ];

    return {
      headers: {
        realm
      },
      key: heroId,
      value: items
    }
  }
}
```

Additionally, messages passed in this format can also contain custom headers set in the `headers` hash property. Header hash property values must be either of type `string` or type `Buffer`.

```typescript
@@filename(heroes.controller)
@Controller()
export class HeroesController {
  @MessagePattern('hero.kill.dragon')
  killDragon(@Payload() message: KillDragonMessage): any {
    const realm = 'Nest';
    const heroId = message.heroId;
    const dragonId = message.dragonId;

    const items = [
      { id: 1, name: 'Mythical Sword' },
      { id: 2, name: 'Key to Dungeon' },
    ];

    return {
      headers: {
        kafka_nestRealm: realm
      },
      key: heroId,
      value: items
    }
  }
}
```

#### Context

In more sophisticated scenarios, you may want to access more information about the incoming request. When using the Kafka transporter, you can access the `KafkaContext` object.

```typescript
@@filename()
@MessagePattern('hero.kill.dragon')
killDragon(@Payload() message: KillDragonMessage, @Ctx() context: KafkaContext) {
  console.log(`Topic: ${context.getTopic()}`);
}
@@switch
@Bind(Payload(), Ctx())
@MessagePattern('hero.kill.dragon')
killDragon(message, context) {
  console.log(`Topic: ${context.getTopic()}`);
}
```

> info **Hint** `@Payload()`, `@Ctx()` and `KafkaContext` are imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

To access the original Kafka `IncomingMessage` object, use the `getMessage()` method of the `KafkaContext` object, as follows:

```typescript
@@filename()
@MessagePattern('hero.kill.dragon')
killDragon(@Payload() message: KillDragonMessage, @Ctx() context: KafkaContext) {
  const originalMessage = context.getMessage();
  const { headers, partition, timestamp } = originalMessage;
}
@@switch
@Bind(Payload(), Ctx())
@MessagePattern('hero.kill.dragon')
killDragon(message, context) {
  const originalMessage = context.getMessage();
  const { headers, partition, timestamp } = originalMessage;
}
```

Where the `IncomingMessage` fulfills the following interface:

```typescript
interface IncomingMessage {
  topic: string;
  partition: number;
  timestamp: string;
  size: number;
  attributes: number;
  offset: string;
  key: any;
  value: any;
  headers: Record<string, any>;
}
```

#### Naming conventions

The Kafka microservice components append a description of their respective role onto the `client.clientId` and `consumer.groupId` options to prevent collisions between Nest microservice client and server components. By default the `ClientKafka` components append `-client` and the `ServerKafka` components append `-server` to both of these options. Note how the provided values below are transformed in that way (as shown in the comments).

```typescript
@@filename(main)
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice(ApplicationModule, {
  transport: Transport.KAFKA,
  options: {
    client: {
      clientId: 'hero', // hero-server
      brokers: ['localhost:9092'],
    },
    consumer: {
      groupId: 'hero-consumer' // hero-consumer-server
    },
  }
});
```

And for the client:

```typescript
@@filename(heroes.controller)
@Client({
  transport: Transport.KAFKA,
  options: {
    client: {
      clientId: 'hero', // hero-client
      brokers: ['localhost:9092'],
    },
    consumer: {
      groupId: 'hero-consumer' // hero-consumer-client
    }
  }
})
client: ClientKafka;
```

> info **Hint** Kafka client and consumer naming conventions can be customized by extending `ClientKafka` and `KafkaServer` in your own custom provider and overriding the constructor.

Since the Kafka microservice message pattern utilizes two topics for the request and reply channels, a reply pattern should be derived from the request topic. By default, the name of the reply topic is the composite of the request topic name with `.reply` appended.

```typescript
@@filename(heroes.controller)
onModuleInit() {
  this.client.subscribeToResponseOf('hero.get'); // hero.get.reply
}
```

> info **Hint** Kafka reply topic naming conventions can be customized by extending `ClientKafka` in your own custom provider and overriding the `getResponsePatternName` method.
### gRPC <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/grpc"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="grpc" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

[gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node) is a modern, open source, high performance RPC framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication.

Like many RPC systems, gRPC is based on the concept of defining a service in terms of functions (methods) that can be called remotely. For each method, you define the parameters and return types. Services, parameters, and return types are defined in `.proto` files using Google's open source language-neutral <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a> mechanism.

With the gRPC transporter, Nest uses `.proto` files to dynamically bind clients and servers to make it easy to implement remote procedure calls, automatically serializing and deserializing structured data.

#### Installation

To start building gRPC-based microservices, first install the required packages:

```bash
$ npm i --save grpc @grpc/proto-loader
```

#### Overview

Like other Nest microservices transport layer implementations, you select the gRPC transporter mechanism using the `transport` property of the options object passed to the `createMicroservice()` method. In the following example, we'll set up a hero service. The `options` property provides metadata about that service; its properties are described <a href="microservices/grpc#options">below</a>.

```typescript
@@filename(main)
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(AppModule, {
  transport: Transport.GRPC,
  options: {
    package: 'hero',
    protoPath: join(__dirname, 'hero/hero.proto'),
  },
});
@@switch
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice(AppModule, {
  transport: Transport.GRPC,
  options: {
    package: 'hero',
    protoPath: join(__dirname, 'hero/hero.proto'),
  },
});
```

> info **Hint** The `join()` function is imported from the `path` package; the `Transport` enum is imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

#### Options

The <strong>gRPC</strong> transporter options object exposes the properties described below.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><code>package</code></td>
    <td>Protobuf package name (matches <code>package</code> setting from <code>.proto</code> file).  Required</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>protoPath</code></td>
    <td>

    <td>Connection url.  String in the format <code>ip address/dns name:port</code> (for example, <code>'localhost:50051'</code>) defining the address/port on which the transporter establishes a connection.  Optional.  Defaults to <code>'localhost:5000'</code></td>
  </tr>

      >
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Sample gRPC service

Let's define our sample gRPC service called `HeroesService`. In the above `options` object, the`protoPath` property sets a path to the `.proto` definitions file `hero.proto`. The `hero.proto` file is structured using <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a>. Here's what it looks like:

```typescript
// hero/hero.proto
syntax = "proto3";

package hero;

service HeroesService {
  rpc FindOne (HeroById) returns (Hero) {}
}

message HeroById {
  int32 id = 1;
}

message Hero {
  int32 id = 1;
  string name = 2;
}
```

Our `HeroesService` exposes a `FindOne()` method. This method expects an input argument of type `HeroById` and returns a `Hero` message (protocol buffers use `message` elements to define both parameter types and return types).

Next, we need to implement the service. To define a handler that fulfills this definition, we use the `@GrpcMethod()` decorator in a controller, as shown below. This decorator provides the metadata needed to declare a method as a gRPC service method.

> info **Hint** The `@MessagePattern()` decorator (<a href="microservices/basics#request-response">read more</a>) introduced in previous microservices chapters is not used with gRPC-based microservices. The `@GrpcMethod()` decorator effectively takes its place for gRPC-based microservices.

```typescript
@@filename(heroes.controller)
@Controller()
export class HeroesController {
  @GrpcMethod('HeroesService', 'FindOne')
  findOne(data: HeroById, metadata: any): Hero {
    const items = [
      { id: 1, name: 'John' },
      { id: 2, name: 'Doe' },
    ];
    return items.find(({ id }) => id === data.id);
  }
}
@@switch
@Controller()
export class HeroesController {
  @GrpcMethod('HeroesService', 'FindOne')
  findOne(data, metadata) {
    const items = [
      { id: 1, name: 'John' },
      { id: 2, name: 'Doe' },
    ];
    return items.find(({ id }) => id === data.id);
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** The `@GrpcMethod()` decorator is imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

The decorator shown above takes two arguments. The first is the service name (e.g., `'HeroesService'`), corresponding to the `HeroesService` service definition in `hero.proto`. The second (the string `'FindOne'`) corresponds to the `FindOne()` rpc method defined within `HeroesService` in the `hero.proto` file.

The `findOne()` handler method takes two arguments, the `data` passed from the caller and `metadata` that stores gRPC request metadata.

Both `@GrpcMethod()` decorator arguments are optional. If called without the second argument (e.g., `'FindOne'`), Nest will automatically associate the `.proto` file rpc method with the handler based on converting the handler name to upper camel case (e.g., the `findOne` handler is associated with the `FindOne` rpc call definition). This is shown below.

```typescript
@@filename(heroes.controller)
@Controller()
export class HeroesController {
  @GrpcMethod('HeroesService')
  findOne(data: HeroById, metadata: any): Hero {
    const items = [
      { id: 1, name: 'John' },
      { id: 2, name: 'Doe' },
    ];
    return items.find(({ id }) => id === data.id);
  }
}
@@switch
@Controller()
export class HeroesController {
  @GrpcMethod('HeroesService')
  findOne(data, metadata) {
    const items = [
      { id: 1, name: 'John' },
      { id: 2, name: 'Doe' },
    ];
    return items.find(({ id }) => id === data.id);
  }
}
```

You can also omit the first `@GrpcMethod()` argument. In this case, Nest automatically associates the handler with the service definition from the proto definitions file based on the **class** name where the handler is defined. For example, in the following code, class `HeroesService` associates its handler methods with the `HeroesService` service definition in the `hero.proto` file based on the matching of the name `'HeroesService'`.

```typescript
@@filename(heroes.controller)
@Controller()
export class HeroesService {
  @GrpcMethod()
  findOne(data: HeroById, metadata: any): Hero {
    const items = [
      { id: 1, name: 'John' },
      { id: 2, name: 'Doe' },
    ];
    return items.find(({ id }) => id === data.id);
  }
}
@@switch
@Controller()
export class HeroesService {
  @GrpcMethod()
  findOne(data, metadata) {
    const items = [
      { id: 1, name: 'John' },
      { id: 2, name: 'Doe' },
    ];
    return items.find(({ id }) => id === data.id);
  }
}
```

#### Client

Nest applications can act as gRPC clients, consuming services defined in `.proto` files. You access remote services through a `ClientGrpc` object. You can obtain a `ClientGrpc` object in several ways.

The preferred technique is to import the `ClientsModule`. Use the `register()` method to bind a package of services defined in a `.proto` file to an injection token, and to configure the service. The `name` property is the injection token. For gRPC services, use `transport: Transport.GRPC`. The `options` property is an object with the same properties described <a href="microservices/grpc#options">above</a>.

```typescript
imports: [
  ClientsModule.register([
    {
      name: 'HERO_PACKAGE',
      transport: Transport.GRPC,
      options: {
        package: 'hero',
        protoPath: join(__dirname, 'hero/hero.proto'),
      },
    },
  ]),
];
```

> info **Hint** The `register()` method takes an array of objects. Register multiple packages by providing a comma separated list of registration objects.

Once registered, we can inject the configured `ClientGrpc` object with `@Inject()`. Then we use the `ClientGrpc` object's `getService()` method to retrieve the service instance, as shown below.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AppService implements OnModuleInit {
  private heroesService: HeroesService;

  constructor(@Inject('HERO_PACKAGE') private client: ClientGrpc) {}

  onModuleInit() {
    this.heroesService = this.client.getService<HeroesService>('HeroesService');
  }

  getHero(): Observable<string> {
    return this.heroesService.findOne({ id: 1 });
  }
}
```

Notice that there is a small difference compared to the technique used in other microservice transport methods. Instead of the `ClientProxy` class, we use the `ClientGrpc` class, which provides the `getService()` method. The `getService()` generic method takes a service name as an argument and returns its instance (if available).

Alternatively, you can use the `@Client()` decorator to instantiate a `ClientGrpc` object, as follows:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AppService implements OnModuleInit {
  @Client({
    transport: Transport.GRPC,
    options: {
      package: 'hero',
      protoPath: join(__dirname, 'hero/hero.proto'),
    },
  })
  client: ClientGrpc;

  private heroesService: HeroesService;

  onModuleInit() {
    this.heroesService = this.client.getService<HeroesService>('HeroesService');
  }

  getHero(): Observable<string> {
    return this.heroesService.findOne({ id: 1 });
  }
}
```

Finally, for more complex scenarios, we can inject a dynamically configured client using the `ClientProxyFactory` class as described <a href="/microservices/basics#client">here</a>.

In either case, we end up with a reference to our `HeroesService` proxy object, which exposes the same set of methods that are defined inside the `.proto` file. Now, when we access this proxy object (i.e., `heroesService`), the gRPC system automatically serializes requests, forwards them to the remote system, returns a response, and deserializes the response. Because gRPC shields us from these network communication details, `heroesService` looks and acts like a local provider.

Note, all service methods are **lower camel cased** (in order to follow the natural convention of the language). So, for example, while our `.proto` file `HeroesService` definition contains the `FindOne()` function, the `heroesService` instance will provide the `findOne()` method.

```typescript
interface HeroesService {
  findOne(data: { id: number }): Observable<any>;
}
```

A message handler is also able to return an¬†`Observable`, in which case the result values will be emitted until the stream is completed.

```typescript
@@filename(heroes.controller)
@Get()
call(): Observable<any> {
  return this.heroesService.findOne({ id: 1 });
}
@@switch
@Get()
call() {
  return this.heroesService.findOne({ id: 1 });
}
```

A full working example is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/04-grpc).

#### gRPC Streaming

gRPC on its own supports long-term live connections, conventionally known as `streams`. Streams are useful for cases such as Chatting, Observations or Chunk-data transfers. Find more details in the official documentation [here](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts/).

Nest supports GRPC stream handlers in two possible ways:

- RxJS `Subject` + `Observable` handler: can be useful to write responses right inside of a Controller method or to be passed down to `Subject`/`Observable` consumer
- Pure GRPC call stream handler: can be useful to be passed to some executor which will handle the rest of dispatch for the Node standard `Duplex` stream handler.

<app-banner-enterprise></app-banner-enterprise>

#### Streaming sample

Let's define a new sample gRPC service called `HelloService`. The `hello.proto` file is structured using <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a>. Here's what it looks like:

```typescript
// hello/hello.proto
syntax = "proto3";

package hello;

service HelloService {
  rpc BidiHello(stream HelloRequest) returns (stream HelloResponse);
  rpc LotsOfGreetings(stream HelloRequest) returns (HelloResponse);
}

message HelloRequest {
  string greeting = 1;
}

message HelloResponse {
  string reply = 1;
}
```

> info **Hint** The `LotsOfGreetings` method can be simply implemented with the `@GrpcMethod` decorator (as in the examples above) since the returned stream can emit multiple values.

Based on this `.proto` file, let's define the `HelloService` interface:

```typescript
interface HelloService {
  bidiHello(upstream: Observable<HelloRequest>): Observable<HelloResponse>;
  lotsOfGreetings(
    upstream: Observable<HelloRequest>,
  ): Observable<HelloResponse>;
}

interface HelloRequest {
  greeting: string;
}

interface HelloResponse {
  reply: string;
}
```

#### Subject strategy

The `@GrpcStreamMethod()` decorator provides the function parameter as an RxJS `Observable`. Thus, we can receive and process multiple messages.

```typescript
@GrpcStreamMethod()
bidiHello(messages: Observable<any>): Observable<any> {
  const subject = new Subject();

  const onNext = message => {
    console.log(message);
    subject.next({
      reply: 'Hello, world!'
    });
  };
  const onComplete = () => subject.complete();
  messages.subscribe(onNext, null, onComplete);

  return subject.asObservable();
}
```

> info **Hint** For supporting full-duplex interaction with the `@GrpcStreamMethod()` decorator, the controller method must return an RxJS `Observable`.

According to the service definition (in the `.proto` file), the `BidiHello` method should stream requests to the service. To send multiple asynchronous messages to the stream from a client, we leverage an RxJS `ReplySubject` class.

```typescript
const helloService = this.client.getService<HelloService>('HelloService');
const helloRequest$ = new ReplaySubject<HelloRequest>();

helloRequest$.next({ greeting: 'Hello (1)!' });
helloRequest$.next({ greeting: 'Hello (2)!' });
helloRequest$.complete();

return helloService.bidiHello(helloRequest$);
```

In the example above, we wrote two messages to the stream (`next()` calls) and notified the service that we've completed sending the data (`complete()` call).

#### Call stream handler

When the method return value is defined as `stream`, the `@GrpcStreamCall()` decorator provides the function parameter as `grpc.ServerDuplexStream`, which supports standard methods like `.on('data', callback)`, `.write(message)` or `.cancel()`. Full documentation on available methods can be found [here](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/node/grpc-ClientDuplexStream.html).

Alternatively, when the method return value is not a `stream`, the `@GrpcStreamCall()` decorator provides two function parameters, respectively `grpc.ServerReadableStream` (read more [here](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/node/grpc-ServerReadableStream.html)) and `callback`.

Let's start with implementing the `BidiHello` which should support a full-duplex interaction.

```typescript
@GrpcStreamCall()
bidiHello(requestStream: any) {
  requestStream.on('data', message => {
    console.log(message);
    requestStream.write({
      reply: 'Hello, world!'
    });
  });
}
```

> info **Hint** This decorator does not require any specific return parameter to be provided. It is expected that the stream will be handled similar to any other standard stream type.

In the example above, we used the `write()` method to write objects to the response stream. The callback passed into the `.on()` method as a second parameter will be called every time our service receives a new chunk of data.

Let's implement the `LotsOfGreetings` method.

```typescript
@GrpcStreamCall()
lotsOfGreetings(requestStream: any, callback: (err: unknown, value: HelloResponse) => void) {
  requestStream.on('data', message => {
    console.log(message);
  });
  requestStream.on('end', () => callback(null, { reply: 'Hello, world!' }));
}
```

Here we used the `callback` function to send the response once processing of the `requestStream` has been completed.
### Exception filters <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/exception-filters"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="exception-filters-ms" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

The only difference between the HTTP [exception filter](/exception-filters) layer and the corresponding microservices layer is that instead of throwing `HttpException`, you should use `RpcException`.

```typescript
throw new RpcException('Invalid credentials.');
```

> info **Hint** The `RpcException` class is imported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

With the sample above, Nest will handle the thrown exception and return the `error` object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Invalid credentials."
}
```

#### Filters

Microservice exception filters behave similarly to HTTP exception filters, with one small difference. The `catch()` method must return an `Observable`.

```typescript
@@filename(rpc-exception.filter)
import { Catch, RpcExceptionFilter, ArgumentsHost } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable, throwError } from 'rxjs';
import { RpcException } from '@nestjs/microservices';

@Catch(RpcException)
export class ExceptionFilter implements RpcExceptionFilter<RpcException> {
  catch(exception: RpcException, host: ArgumentsHost): Observable<any> {
    return throwError(exception.getError());
  }
}
@@switch
import { Catch } from '@nestjs/common';
import { throwError } from 'rxjs';

@Catch(RpcException)
export class ExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception, host) {
    return throwError(exception.getError());
  }
}
```

> **Warning** You cannot set up global microservice exception filters when using a [hybrid application](/faq/hybrid-application).

The following example uses a manually instantiated method-scoped filter. Just as with HTTP based applications, you can also use controller-scoped filters (i.e., prefix the controller class with a `@UseFilters()` decorator).

```typescript
@@filename()
@UseFilters(new ExceptionFilter())
@MessagePattern({ cmd: 'sum' })
accumulate(data: number[]): number {
  return (data || []).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}
@@switch
@UseFilters(new ExceptionFilter())
@MessagePattern({ cmd: 'sum' })
accumulate(data) {
  return (data || []).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}
```

#### Inheritance

Typically, you'll create fully customized exception filters crafted to fulfill your application requirements. However, there might be use-cases when you would like to simply extend the **core exception filter**, and override the behavior based on certain factors.

In order to delegate exception processing to the base filter, you need to extend `BaseExceptionFilter` and call the inherited `catch()` method.

```typescript
@@filename()
import { Catch, ArgumentsHost } from '@nestjs/common';
import { BaseRpcExceptionFilter } from '@nestjs/microservices';

@Catch()
export class AllExceptionsFilter extends BaseRpcExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception: any, host: ArgumentsHost) {
    return super.catch(exception, host);
  }
}
@@switch
import { Catch } from '@nestjs/common';
import { BaseRpcExceptionFilter } from '@nestjs/microservices';

@Catch()
export class AllExceptionsFilter extends BaseRpcExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception, host) {
    return super.catch(exception, host);
  }
}
```

The above implementation is just a shell demonstrating the approach. Your implementation of the extended exception filter would include your tailored **business logic** (e.g., handling various conditions).
### Pipes <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/pipes"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="pipes-ms" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

There is no fundamental difference between [regular pipes](/pipes) and microservices pipes. The only difference is that instead of throwing `HttpException`, you should use `RpcException`.

> info **Hint** The `RpcException` class is exposed from `@nestjs/microservices` package.

#### Binding pipes

The following example uses a manually instantiated method-scoped pipe. Just as with HTTP based applications, you can also use controller-scoped pipes (i.e., prefix the controller class with a `@UsePipes()` decorator).

```typescript
@@filename()
@UsePipes(new ValidationPipe())
@MessagePattern({ cmd: 'sum' })
accumulate(data: number[]): number {
  return (data || []).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}
@@switch
@UsePipes(new ValidationPipe())
@MessagePattern({ cmd: 'sum' })
accumulate(data) {
  return (data || []).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}
```
### Guards <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/guards"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="guards-ms" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

There is no fundamental difference between microservices guards and [regular HTTP application guards](/guards).
The only difference is that instead of throwing `HttpException`, you should use `RpcException`.

> info **Hint** The `RpcException` class is exposed from `@nestjs/microservices` package.

#### Binding guards

The following example uses a method-scoped guard. Just as with HTTP based applications, you can also use controller-scoped guards (i.e., prefix the controller class with a `@UseGuards()` decorator).

```typescript
@@filename()
@UseGuards(AuthGuard)
@MessagePattern({ cmd: 'sum' })
accumulate(data: number[]): number {
  return (data || []).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}
@@switch
@UseGuards(AuthGuard)
@MessagePattern({ cmd: 'sum' })
accumulate(data) {
  return (data || []).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}
```
### Interceptors <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/interceptors"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="interceptors-ms" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

There is no difference between [regular interceptors](/interceptors) and microservices interceptors. The following example uses a manually instantiated method-scoped interceptor. Just as with HTTP based applications, you can also use controller-scoped interceptors (i.e., prefix the controller class with a `@UseInterceptors()` decorator).

```typescript
@@filename()
@UseInterceptors(new TransformInterceptor())
@MessagePattern({ cmd: 'sum' })
accumulate(data: number[]): number {
  return (data || []).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}
@@switch
@UseInterceptors(new TransformInterceptor())
@MessagePattern({ cmd: 'sum' })
accumulate(data) {
  return (data || []).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}
```

### Overview <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="overview" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

The [Nest CLI](https://github.com/nestjs/nest-cli) is a command-line interface tool that helps you to initialize, develop, and maintain your Nest applications. It assists in multiple ways, including scaffolding the project, serving it in development mode, and building and bundling the application for production distribution. It embodies best-practice architectural patterns to encourage well-structured apps.

#### Installation

**Note**: In this guide we describe using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install packages, including the Nest CLI. Other package managers may be used at your discretion. With npm, you have several options available for managing how your OS command line resolves the location of the `nest` CLI binary file. Here, we describe installing the `nest` binary globally using the `-g` option. This provides a measure of convenience, and is the approach we assume throughout the documentation. Note that installing **any** `npm` package globally leaves the responsibility of ensuring they're running the correct version up to the user. It also means that if you have different projects, each will run the **same** version of the CLI. A reasonable alternative is to use the [npx](https://github.com/npm/npx) program (or similar features with other package managers) to ensure that you run a **managed version** of the Nest CLI. We recommend you consult the [npx documentation](https://github.com/npm/npx) and/or your DevOps support staff for more information.

Install the CLI globally using the `npm install -g` command (see the **Note** above for details about global installs).

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

#### Basic workflow

Once installed, you can invoke CLI commands directly from your OS command line through the `nest` executable. See the available `nest` commands by entering the following:

```bash
$ nest --help
```

Get help on an individual command using the following construct. Substitute any command, like `new`, `add`, etc., where you see `generate` in the example below to get detailed help on that command:

```bash
$ nest generate --help
```

To create, build and run a new basic Nest project in development mode, go to the folder that should be the parent of your new project, and run the following commands:

```bash
$ nest new my-nest-project
$ cd my-nest-project
$ npm run start:dev
```

In your browser, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the new application running. The app will automatically recompile and reload when you change any of the source files.

#### Project structure

When you run `nest new`, Nest generates a boilerplate application structure by creating a new folder and populating an initial set of files. You can continue working in this default structure, adding new components, as described throughout this documentation. We refer to the project structure generated by `nest new` as **standard mode**. Nest also supports an alternate structure for managing multiple projects and libraries called **monorepo mode**.

Aside from a few specific considerations around how the **build** process works (essentially, monorepo mode simplifies build complexities that can sometimes arise from monorepo-style project structures), and built-in [library](/cli/libraries) support, the rest of the Nest features, and this documentation, apply equally to both standard and monorepo mode project structures. In fact, you can easily switch from standard mode to monorepo mode at any time in the future, so you can safely defer this decision while you're still learning about Nest.

You can use either mode to manage multiple projects. Here's a quick summary of the differences:

| Feature                                              | Standard Mode                                                      | Monorepo Mode                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multiple projects                                    | Separate file system structure                                     | Single file system structure                               |
| `node_modules` & `package.json`                      | Separate instances                                                 | Shared across monorepo                                     |
| Default compiler                                     | `tsc`                                                              | webpack                                                    |
| Compiler settings                                    | Specified separately                                               | Monorepo defaults that can be overridden per project       |
| Config files like `tslint.json`, `.prettierrc`, etc. | Specified separately                                               | Shared across monorepo                                     |
| `nest build` and `nest start` commands               | Target defaults automatically to the (only) project in the context | Target defaults to the **default project** in the monorepo |
| Libraries                                            | Managed manually, usually via npm packaging                        | Built-in support, including path management and bundling   |

Read the sections on [Workspaces](/cli/monorepo) and [Libraries](/cli/libraries) for more detailed information to help you decide which mode is most suitable for you.

#### CLI command syntax

All `nest` commands follow the same format:

```bash
nest commandOrAlias requiredArg [optionalArg] [options]
```

For example:

```bash
$ nest new my-nest-project --dry-run
```

Here, `new` is the _commandOrAlias_. The `new` command has an alias of `n`. `my-nest-project` is the _requiredArg_. If a _requiredArg_ is not supplied on the command line, `nest` will prompt for it. Also, `--dry-run` has an equivalent short-hand form `-d`. With this in mind, the following command is the equivalent of the above:

```bash
$ nest n my-nest-project -d
```

Most commands, and some options, have aliases. Try running `nest new --help` to see these options and aliases, and to confirm your understanding of the above constructs.

#### Command overview

Run `nest <command> --help` for any of the following commands to see command-specific options.

See [usage](/cli/usages) for detailed descriptions for each command.

| Command    | Alias | Description                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `new`      | `n`   | Scaffolds a new _standard mode_ application with all boilerplate files needed to run.                 |
| `generate` | `g`   | Generates and/or modifies files based on a schematic.                                                 |
| `build`    |       | Compiles an application or workspace into an output folder.                                           |
| `start`    |       | Compiles and runs an application (or default project in a workspace).                                 |
| `add`      |       | Imports a library that has been packaged as a **nest library**, running its install schematic.        |
| `update`   | `u`   | Update `@nestjs` dependencies in the `package.json` `"dependencies"` list to their `@latest` version. |
| `info`     | `i`   | Displays information about installed nest packages and other helpful system info.                     |

### Workspaces <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/monorepo"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="monorepo" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Nest has two modes for organizing code:

- **standard mode**: useful for building individual project-focused applications that have their own dependencies and settings, and don't need to optimize for sharing modules, or optimizing complex builds. This is the default mode.
- **monorepo mode**: this mode treats code artifacts as part of a lightweight **monorepo**, and may be more appropriate for teams of developers and/or multi-project environments. It automates parts of the build process to make it easy to create and compose modular components, promotes code re-use, makes integration testing easier, makes it easy to share project-wide artifacts like `tslint` rules and other configuration policies, and is easier to use than alternatives like github submodules. Monorepo mode employs the concept of a **workspace**, represented in the `nest-cli.json` file, to coordinate the relationship between the components of the monorepo.

It's important to note that virtually all of Nest's features are independent of your code organization mode. The **only** affect of this choice is how your projects are composed and how build artifacts are generated. All other functionality, from the CLI to core modules to add-on modules work the same in either mode.

Also, you can easily switch from **standard mode** to **monorepo mode** at any time, so you can delay this decision until the benefits of one or the other approach become more clear.

#### Standard mode

When you run `nest new`, a new **project** is created for you using a built-in schematic. Nest does the following:

1. Create a new folder, corresponding to the `name` argument you provide to `nest new`
2. Populate that folder with default files corresponding to a minimal base-level Nest application. You can examine these files at the [typescript-starter](https://github.com/nestjs/typescript-starter) repository.
3. Provide additional files such as `nest-cli.json`, `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` that configure and enable various tools for compiling, testing and serving your application.

From there, you can modify the starter files, add new components, add dependencies (e.g., `npm install`), and otherwise develop your application as covered in the rest of this documentation.

#### Monorepo mode

To enable monorepo mode, you start with a _standard mode_ structure, and add **projects**. A project can be a full **application** (which you add to the workspace with the command `nest generate app`) or a **library** (which you add to the workspace with the command `nest generate library`). We'll discuss the details of these specific types of project components below. The key point to note now is that it is the **act of adding a project** to an existing standard mode structure that **converts it** to monorepo mode. Let's look at an example.

If we run:

```bash
nest new my-project
```

We've constructed a _standard mode_ structure, with a folder structure that looks like this:

<div class="file-tree">
  <div class="item">src</div>
  <div class="children">
    <div class="item">app.controller.ts</div>
    <div class="item">app.service.ts</div>
    <div class="item">app.module.ts</div>
    <div class="item">main.ts</div>
  </div>
  <div class="item">node_modules</div>
  <div class="item">nest-cli.json</div>
  <div class="item">package.json</div>
  <div class="item">tsconfig.json</div>
  <div class="item">tslint.json</div>
</div>

We can convert this to a monorepo mode structure as follows:

```bash
cd my-project
nest generate app my-app
```

At this point, `nest` converts the existing structure to a **monorepo mode** structure. This results in a few important changes. The folder structure now looks like this:

<div class="file-tree">
  <div class="item">apps</div>
    <div class="children">
      <div class="item">my-app</div>
      <div class="children">
        <div class="item">src</div>
        <div class="children">
          <div class="item">app.controller.ts</div>
          <div class="item">app.service.ts</div>
          <div class="item">app.module.ts</div>
          <div class="item">main.ts</div>
        </div>
        <div class="item">tsconfig.app.json</div>
      </div>
      <div class="item">my-project</div>
      <div class="children">
        <div class="item">src</div>
        <div class="children">
          <div class="item">app.controller.ts</div>
          <div class="item">app.service.ts</div>
          <div class="item">app.module.ts</div>
          <div class="item">main.ts</div>
        </div>
        <div class="item">tsconfig.app.json</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  <div class="item">nest-cli.json</div>
  <div class="item">package.json</div>
  <div class="item">tsconfig.json</div>

The `generate app` schematic has reorganized the code - moving each **application** project under the `apps` folder, and adding a project-specific `tsconfig.app.json` file in each project's root folder. Our original `my-project` app has become the **default project** for the monorepo, and is now a peer with the just-added `my-app`, located under the `apps` folder. We'll cover default projects below.

> error **Warning** The conversion of a standard mode structure to monorepo only works for projects that have followed the canonical Nest project structure. Specifically, during conversion, the schematic attempts to relocate the `src` and `test` folders in a project folder beneath the `apps` folder in the root. If a project does not use this structure, the conversion will fail or produce unreliable results.

#### Workspace projects

A monorepo uses the concept of a workspace to manage its member entities. Workspaces are composed of **projects**. A project may be either:

- an **application**: a full Nest application including a `main.ts` file to bootstrap the application. Aside from compile and build considerations, an application-type project within a workspace is functionally identical to an application within a _standard mode_ structure.
- a **library**: a library is a way of packaging a general purpose set of features (modules, providers, controllers, etc.) that can be used within other projects. A library cannot run on its own, and has no `main.ts` file. Read more about libraries [here](/cli/libraries).

All workspaces have a **default project** (which should be an application-type project). This is defined by the top-level `"root"` property in the `nest-cli.json` file, which points at the root of the default project (see [CLI properties](/cli/monorepo#cli-properties) below for more details). Usually, this is the **standard mode** application you started with, and later converted to a monorepo using `nest generate app`. When you follow these steps, this property is populated automatically.

Default projects are used by `nest` commands like `nest build` and `nest start` when a project name is not supplied.

For example, in the above monorepo structure, running

```bash
$ nest start
```

will start up the `my-project` app. To start `my-app`, we'd use:

```bash
$ nest start my-app
```

#### Applications

Application-type projects, or what we might informally refer to as just "applications", are complete Nest applications that you can run and deploy. You generate an application-type project with `nest generate app`.

This command automatically generates a project skeleton, including the standard `src` and `test` folders from the [typescript starter](https://github.com/nestjs/typescript-starter). Unlike standard mode, an application project in a monorepo does not have any of the package dependency (`package.json`) or other project configuration artifacts like `.prettierrc` and `tslint.json`. Instead, the monorepo-wide dependencies and config files are used.

However, the schematic does generate a project-specific `tsconfig.app.json` file in the root folder of the project. This config file automatically sets appropriate build options, including setting the compilation output folder properly. The file extends the top-level (monorepo) `tsconfig.json` file, so you can manage global settings monorepo-wide, but override them if needed at the project level.

#### Libraries

As mentioned, library-type projects, or simply "libraries", are packages of Nest components that need to be composed into applications in order to run. You generate a library-type project with `nest generate library`. Deciding what belongs in a library is an architectural design decision. We discuss libraries in depth in the [libraries](/cli/libraries) chapter.

#### CLI properties

Nest keeps the metadata needed to organize, build and deploy both standard and monorepo structured projects in the `nest-cli.json` file. Nest automatically adds to and updates this file as you add projects, so you usually do not have to think about it or edit its contents. However, there are some settings you may want to change manually, so it's helpful to have an overview understanding of the file.

After running the steps above to create a monorepo, our `nest-cli.json` file looks like this:

```javascript
{
  "collection": "@nestjs/schematics",
  "sourceRoot": "apps/my-project/src",
  "monorepo": true,
  "root": "apps/my-project",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "webpack": true,
    "tsConfigPath": "apps/my-project/tsconfig.app.json"
  },
  "projects": {
    "my-project": {
      "type": "application",
      "root": "apps/my-project",
      "entryFile": "main",
      "sourceRoot": "apps/my-project/src",
      "compilerOptions": {
        "tsConfigPath": "apps/my-project/tsconfig.app.json"
      }
    },
    "my-app": {
      "type": "application",
      "root": "apps/my-app",
      "entryFile": "main",
      "sourceRoot": "apps/my-app/src",
      "compilerOptions": {
        "tsConfigPath": "apps/my-app/tsconfig.app.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The file is divided into sections:

- a global section with top-level properties controlling standard and monorepo-wide settings
- a top level property (`"projects"`) with metadata about each project. This section is present only for monorepo-mode structures.

The top-level properties are as follows:

- `"collection"`: points at the collection of schematics used to generate components; you generally should not change this value
- `"sourceRoot"`: points at the root of the source code for the single project in standard mode structures, or the _default project_ in monorepo mode structures
- `"compilerOptions"`: a map with keys specifying compiler options and values specifying the option setting; see details below
- `"generateOptions"`: a map with keys specifying global generate options and values specifying the option setting; see details below
- `"monorepo"`: (monorepo only) for a monorepo mode structure, this value is always `true`
- `"root"`: (monorepo only) points at the project root of the _default project_

#### Global compiler options

These properties specify the compiler to use as well as various options that affect **any** compilation step, whether as part of `nest build` or `nest start`, and regardless of the compiler, whether `tsc` or webpack.

| Property Name       | Property Value Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `webpack`           | boolean             | If `true`, use [webpack compiler](https://webpack.js.org/). If `false` or not present, use `tsc`. In monorepo mode, the default is `true` (use webpack), in standard mode, the default is `false` (use `tsc`). See below for details. |
| `tsConfigPath`      | string              | (**monorepo only**) Points at the file containing the `tsconfig.json` settings that will be used when `nest build` or `nest start` is called without a `project` option (e.g., when the default project is built or started).         |
| `webpackConfigPath` | string              | Points at a webpack options file. If not specified, Nest looks for the file `webpack.config.js`. See below for more details.                                                                                                          |
| `deleteOutDir`      | boolean             | If `true`, whenever the compiler is invoked, it will first remove the compilation output directory (as configured in `tsconfig.json`, where the default is `./dist`).                                                                 |
| `assets`            | array               | Enables automatically distributing non-TypeScript assets whenever a compilation step begins (asset distribution does **not** happen on incremental compiles in `--watch` mode). See below for details.                                |
| `watchAssets`       | boolean             | If `true`, run in watch-mode, watching **all** non-TypeScript assets. (For more fine-grained control of the assets to watch, see [Assets](cli/monorepo#assets) section below).                                                        |

#### Global generate options

These properties specify the default generate options to be used by the `nest generate` command.

| Property Name | Property Value Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `spec`        | boolean _or_ object | If the value is boolean, a value of `true` enables `spec` generation by default and a value of `false` disables it. A flag passed on the CLI command line overrides this setting, as does a project-specific `generateOptions` setting (more below). If the value is an object, each key represents a schematic name, and the boolean value determines whether the default spec generation is enabled / disabled for that specific schematic. |

The following example uses a boolean value to specify that spec file generation should be disabled by default for all projects:

```javascript
{
  "generateOptions": {
    "spec": false
  },
  ...
}
```

In the following example, `spec` file generation is disabled only for `service` schematics (e.g., `nest generate service...`):

```javascript
{
  "generateOptions": {
    "spec": {
      "service": false
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

> error **Warning** When specifying the `spec` as an object, the key for the generation schematic does not currently support automatic alias handling. This means that specifying a key as for example `service: false` and trying to generate a service via the alias `s`, the spec would still be generated. To make sure both the normal schematic name and the alias work as intended, specify both the normal command name as well as the alias, as seen below.
>
> ```javascript
> {
>   "generateOptions": {
>     "spec": {
>       "service": false,
>       "s": false
>     }
>   },
>   ...
> }
> ```

#### Project-specific generate options

In addition to providing global generate options, you may also specify project-specific generate options. The project specific generate options follow the exact same format as the global generate options, but are specified directly on each project.

Project-specific generate options override global generate options.

```javascript
{
  "projects": {
    "cats-project": {
      "generateOptions": {
        "spec": {
          "service": false
        }
      },
      ...
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

> notice **Notice** The order of precedence for generate options is as follows. Options specified on the CLI command line take precedence over project-specific options. Project-specific options override global options.

#### Specified compiler

The reason for the different default compilers is that for larger projects (e.g., more typical in a monorepo) webpack can have significant advantages in build times and in producing a single file bundling all project components together. If you wish to generate individual files, set `"webpack"` to `false`, which will cause the build process to use `tsc`.

#### Webpack options

The webpack options file can contain standard [webpack configuration options](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/). For example, to tell webpack to bundle `node_modules` (which are excluded by default), add the following to `webpack.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  externals: [],
};
```

Since the webpack config file is a JavaScript file, you can even expose a function that takes default options and returns a modified object:

```javascript
module.exports = function(options) {
  return {
    ...options,
    externals: [],
  };
};
```

#### Assets

TypeScript compilation automatically distributes compiler output (`.js` and `.d.ts` files) to the specified output directory. It can also be convenient to distribute non-TypeScript files, such as `.graphql` files, `images`, `.html` files and other assets. This allows you to treat `nest build` (and any initial compilation step) as a lightweight **development build** step, where you may be editing non-TypeScript files and iteratively compiling and testing.

The value of the `assets` key should be an array of elements specifying the files to be distributed. The elements can be simple strings with `glob`-like file specs, for example:

```typescript
"assets": ["**/*.graphql"],
"watchAssets": true,
```

For finer control, the elements can be objects with the following keys:

- `"include"`: `glob`-like file specifications for the assets to be distributed
- `"exclude"`: `glob`-like file specifications for assets to be **excluded** from the `include` list
- `"outDir"`: a string specifying the path (relative to the root folder) where the assets should be distributed. Defaults to the same output directory configured for compiler output.
- `"watchAssets"`: boolean; if `true`, run in watch mode watching specified assets

For example:

```typescript
"assets": [
  { "include": "**/*.graphql", "exclude": "**/omitted.graphql", "watchAssets": true },
]
```

> error **Warning** Setting `watchAssets` in a top-level `compilerOptions` property overrides any `watchAssets` settings within the `assets` property.

#### Project properties

This element exists only for monorepo-mode structures. You generally should not edit these properties, as they are used by Nest to locate projects and their configuration options within the monorepo.
### Libraries <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/libraries"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="libraries" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Many applications need to solve the same general problems, or re-use a modular component in several different contexts. Nest has a few ways of addressing this, but each works at a different level to solve the problem in a way that helps meet different architectural and organizational objectives.

Nest [modules](/modules) are useful for providing an execution context that enables sharing components within a single application. Modules can also be packaged with [npm](https://npmjs.com) to create a reusable library that can be installed in different projects. This can be an effective way to distribute configurable, re-usable libraries that can be used by different, loosely connected or unafilliated organizations (e.g., by distributing/installing 3rd party libraries).

For sharing code within closely organized groups (e.g., within company/project boundaries), it can be useful to have a more lightweight approach to sharing components. Monorepo's have arisen as a construct to enable that, and within a monorepo, a **library** provides a way to share code in an easy, lightweight fashion. In a Nest monorepo, using libraries enables easy assembly of applications that share components. In fact, this encourages decomposition of monolithic applications and development processes to focus on building and composing modular components.

#### Nest libraries

A Nest library is a Nest project that differs from an application in that it cannot run on its own. A library must be imported into a containing application in order for its code to execute. The built-in support for libraries described in this section is only available for **monorepos** (standard mode projects can achieve similar functionality using npm packages).

For example, an organization may develop an `AuthModule` that manages authentication by implementing company policies that govern all internal applications. Rather than build that module separately for each application, or physically packaging the code with npm and requiring each project to install it, a monorepo can define this module as a library. When organized this way, all consumers of the library module can see an up-to-date version of the `AuthModule` as it is committed. This can have significant benefits for coordinating component development and assembly, and simplifying end-to-end testing.

#### Creating libraries

Any functionality that is suitable for re-use is a candidate for being managed as a library. Deciding what should be a library, and what should be part of an application, is an architectural design decision. Creating libraries involves more than simply copying code from an existing application to a new library. When packaged as a library, the library code must be decoupled from the application. This may require **more** time up front and force some design decisions that you may not face with more tightly coupled code. But this additional effort can pay off when the library can be used to enable more rapid application assembly across multiple applications.

To get started with creating a library, run the following command:

```bash
nest g library my-library
```

When you run the command, the `library` schematic prompts you for a prefix (AKA alias) for the library:

```bash
What prefix would you like to use for the library (default: @app)?
```

This creates a new project in your workspace called `my-library`.
A library-type project, like an application-type project, is generated into a named folder using a schematic. Libraries are managed under the `libs` folder of the monorepo root. Nest creates the `libs` folder the first time a library is created.

The files generated for a library are slightly different from those generated for an application. Here is the contents of the `libs` folder after executing the command above:

<div class="file-tree">
  <div class="item">libs</div>
  <div class="children">
    <div class="item">my-library</div>
    <div class="children">
      <div class="item">src</div>
      <div class="children">
        <div class="item">my-library.service.ts</div>
        <div class="item">my-library.module.ts</div>
        <div class="item">index.ts</div>
      </div>
      <div class="item">tsconfig.lib.json</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

The `nest-cli.json` file will have a new entry for the library under the `"projects"` key:

```javascript
...
{
    "my-library": {
      "type": "library",
      "root": "libs/my-library",
      "entryFile": "index",
      "sourceRoot": "libs/my-library/src",
      "compilerOptions": {
        "tsConfigPath": "libs/my-library/tsconfig.lib.json"
      }
}
...
```

There are two differences in `nest-cli.json` metadata between libraries and applications:

- the `"type"` property is set to `"library"` instead of `"application"`
- the `"entryFile"` property is set to `"index"` instead of `"main"`

These differences key the build process to handle libraries appropriately. For example, a library exports its functions through the `index.js` file.

As with application-type projects, libraries each have their own `tsconfig.lib.json` file that extends the root (monorepo-wide) `tsconfig.json` file. You can modify this file, if necessary, to provide library-specific compiler options.

You can build the library with the CLI command:

```bash
nest build my-library
```

#### Using libraries

With the automatically generated configuration files in place, using libraries is straightforward. How would we import `MyLibraryService` from the `my-library` library into the `my-project` application?

First, note that using library modules is the same as using any other Nest module. What the monorepo does is manage paths in a way that importing libraries and generating builds is now transparent. To use `MyLibraryService`, we need to import its declaring module. We can modify `my-project/src/app.module.ts` as follows to import `MyLibraryModule`.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { MyLibraryModule } from '@app/my-library';

@Module({
  imports: [MyLibraryModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Notice above that we've used a path alias of `@app` in the ES module `import` line, which was the `prefix` we supplied with the `nest g library` command above. Under the covers, Nest handles this through tsconfig path mapping. When adding a library, Nest updates the global (monorepo) `tsconfig.json` file's `"paths"` key like this:

```javascript
"paths": {
    "@app/my-library": [
        "libs/my-library/src"
    ],
    "@app/my-library/*": [
        "libs/my-library/src/*"
    ]
}
```

So, in a nutshell, the combination of the monorepo and library features has made it easy and intuitive to include library modules into applications.

This same mechanism enables building and deploying applications that compose libraries. Once you've imported the `MyLibraryModule`, running `nest build` handles all the module resolution automatically and bundles the app along with any library dependencies, for deployment. The default compiler for a monorepo is **webpack**, so the resulting distribution file is a single file that bundles all of the transpiled JavaScript files into a single file. You can also switch to `tsc` as described <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/monorepo#global-compiler-options">here</a>.

### Nest CLI and scripts <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/scripts"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="scripts" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

This section provides additional background on how the `nest` command interacts with compilers and scripts to help DevOps personnel manage the development environment.

A Nest application is a **standard** TypeScript application that needs to be compiled to JavaScript before it can be executed. There are various ways to accomplish the compilation step, and developers/teams are free to choose a way that works best for them. With that in mind, Nest provides a set of tools out-of-the-box that seek to do the following:

- Provide a standard build/execute process, available at the command line, that "just works" with reasonable defaults.
- Ensure that the build/execute process is **open**, so developers can directly access the underlying tools to customize them using native features and options.
- Remain a completely standard TypeScript/Node.js framework, so that the entire compile/deploy/execute pipeline can be managed by any external tools that the development team chooses to use.

This goal is accomplished through a combination of the `nest` command, a locally installed TypeScript compiler, and `package.json` scripts. We describe how these technologies work together below. This should help you understand what's happening at each step of the build/execute process, and how to customize that behavior if necessary.

#### The nest binary

The `nest` command is an OS level binary (i.e., runs from the OS command line). This command actually encompasses 3 distinct areas, described below. We recommend that you run the build (`nest build`) and execution (`nest start`) sub-commands via the `package.json` scripts provided automatically when a project is scaffolded (see [typescript starter](https://github.com/nestjs/typescript-starter) if you wish to start by cloning a repo, instead of running `nest new`).

#### Build

`nest build` is a wrapper on top of the standard `tsc` compiler (for [standard projects](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview#project-structure)) or the webpack compiler (for [monorepos](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview#project-structure)). It does not add any other compilation features or steps except for handling `tsconfig-paths` out of the box. The reason it exists is that most developers, especially when starting out with Nest, do not need to adjust compiler options (e.g., `tsconfig.json` file) which can sometimes be tricky.

See the [nest build](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/usages#nest-build) documentation for more details.

#### Execution

`nest start` simply ensures the project has been built (same as `nest build`), then invokes the `node` command in a portable, easy way to execute the compiled application. As with builds, you are free to customize this process as needed, either using the `nest start` command and its options, or completely replacing it. The entire process is a standard TypeScript application build and execute pipeline, and you are free to manage the process as such.

See the [nest start](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/usages#nest-start) documentation for more details.

#### Generation

The `nest generate` commands, as the name implies, generate new Nest projects, or components within them.

#### Package scripts

Running the `nest` commands at the OS command level requires that the `nest` binary be installed globally. This is a standard feature of npm, and outside of Nest's direct control. One consequence of this is that the globally installed `nest` binary is **not** managed as a project dependency in `package.json`. For example, two different developers can be running two different versions of the `nest` binary. The standard solution for this is to use package scripts so that you can treat the tools used in the build and execute steps as development dependencies.

When you run `nest new`, or clone the [typescript starter](https://github.com/nestjs/typescript-starter), Nest populates the new project's `package.json` scripts with commands like `build` and `start`. It also installs the underlying compiler tools (such as `typescript`) as **dev dependencies**.

You run the build and execute scripts with commands like:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

and

```bash
$ npm run start
```

These commands use npm's script running capabilities to execute `nest build` or `nest start` using the **locally installed** `nest` binary. By using these built-in package scripts, you have full dependency management over the Nest CLI commands\*. This means that, by following this **recommended** usage, all members of your organization can be assured of running the same version of the commands.

\*This applies to the `build` and `start` commands. The `nest new` and `nest generate` commands aren't part of the build/execute pipeline, so they operate in a different context, and do not come with built-in `package.json` scripts.

For most developers/teams, it is recommended to utilize the package scripts for building and executing their Nest projects. You can fully customize the behavior of these scripts via their options (`--path`, `--webpack`, `--webpackPath`) and/or customize the `tsc` or webpack compiler options files (e.g., `tsconfig.json`) as needed. You are also free to run a completely custom build process to compile the TypeScript (or even to execute TypeScript directly with `ts-node`).

#### Backward compatibility

Because Nest applications are pure TypeScript applications, previous versions of the Nest build/execute scripts will continue to operate. You are not required to upgrade them. You can choose to take advantage of the new `nest build` and `nest start` commands when you are ready, or continue running previous or customized scripts.

#### Migration

While you are not required to make any changes, you may want to migrate to using the new CLI commands instead of using tools such as `tsc-watch` or `ts-node`. In this case, simply install the latest version of the `@nestjs/cli`, both globally and locally:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/cli
$ cd  /some/project/root/folder
$ npm install -D @nestjs/cli
```

You can then replace the `scripts` defined in `package.json` with the following ones:

```typescript
"build": "nest build",
"start": "nest start",
"start:dev": "nest start --watch",
"start:debug": "nest start --debug --watch",
```

### Introduction <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="introduction" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

The [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification is a language-agnostic definition format used to describe RESTful APIs. Nest provides a dedicated [module](https://github.com/nestjs/swagger) which allows generating such a specification by leveraging decorators.

#### Installation

To begin using it, we first install the required dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install --save @nestjs/swagger swagger-ui-express
```

If you use fastify, install `fastify-swagger` instead of `swagger-ui-express`:

```bash
$ npm install --save @nestjs/swagger fastify-swagger
```

#### Bootstrap

Once the installation process is complete, open the `main.ts` file and initialize Swagger using the `SwaggerModule` class:

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { SwaggerModule, DocumentBuilder } from '@nestjs/swagger';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

  const options = new DocumentBuilder()
    .setTitle('Cats example')
    .setDescription('The cats API description')
    .setVersion('1.0')
    .addTag('cats')
    .build();
  const document = SwaggerModule.createDocument(app, options);
  SwaggerModule.setup('api', app, document);

  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

The `DocumentBuilder` helps to structure a base document that conforms to the OpenAPI Specification. It provides several methods that allow setting such properties as title, description, version, etc. In order to create a full document (with all HTTP routes defined) we use the `createDocument()` method of the `SwaggerModule` class. This method takes two arguments, an application instance and a Swagger options object.

Once we create a document, we can call the `setup()` method. It accepts:

1. the path to mount the Swagger UI
2. an application instance
3. the document object instantiated above

Now you can run the following command to start the HTTP server:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

While the application is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api`. You should see the Swagger UI.

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/swagger1.png" /></figure>

The `SwaggerModule` automatically reflects all of your endpoints. Note that the Swagger UI is created using either `swagger-ui-express` or `fastify-swagger`, depending on the platform.

> info **Hint** To generate and download a Swagger JSON file, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api-json` in your browser (assuming that your Swagger documentation is available under `http://localhost:3000/api`).

#### Example

A working example is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/11-swagger).
### Types and parameters <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/types-and-parameters"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="types-and-parameters" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

The `SwaggerModule` searches for all `@Body()`, `@Query()`, and `@Param()` decorators in route handlers to generate the API document. It also creates corresponding model definitions by taking advantage of reflection. Consider the following code:

```typescript
@Post()
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
```

> info **Hint** To explicitly set the body definition use the `@ApiBody()` decorator (imported from the `@nestjs/swagger` package).

Based on the `CreateCatDto`, the following model definition Swagger UI will be created:

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/swagger-dto.png" /></figure>

As you can see, the definition is empty although the class has a few declared properties. In order to make the class properties visible to the `SwaggerModule`, we have to either annotate them with the `@ApiProperty()` decorator or use the CLI plugin (read more in the **Plugin** section) which will do it automatically:

```typescript
import { ApiProperty } from '@nestjs/swagger';

export class CreateCatDto {
  @ApiProperty()
  name: string;

  @ApiProperty()
  age: number;

  @ApiProperty()
  breed: string;
}
```

> info **Hint** Instead of manually annotating each property, consider using the Swagger plugin (see [Plugin](/openapi/cli-plugin) section) which will automatically provide this for you.

Let's open the browser and verify the generated `CreateCatDto` model:

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/swagger-dto2.png" /></figure>

In addition, the `@ApiProperty()` decorator allows setting various [Schema Object](https://swagger.io/specification/#schemaObject) properties:

```typescript
@ApiProperty({
  description: 'The age of a cat',
  minimum: 1,
  default: 1,
})
age: number;
```

> info **Hint** Instead of explicitly typing the `{{"@ApiProperty({ required: false })"}}` you can use the `@ApiPropertyOptional()` short-hand decorator.

In order to explicitly set the type of the property, use the `type` key:

```typescript
@ApiProperty({
  type: Number,
})
age: number;
```

#### Arrays

When the property is an array, we must manually indicate the array type as shown below:

```typescript
@ApiProperty({ type: [String] })
names: string[];
```

> info **Hint** Consider using the Swagger plugin (see [Plugin](/openapi/cli-plugin) section) which will automatically detect arrays.

Either include the type as the first element of an array (as shown above) or set the `isArray` property to `true`.

<app-banner-enterprise></app-banner-enterprise>

#### Circular dependencies

When you have circular dependencies between classes, use a lazy function to provide the `SwaggerModule` with type information:

```typescript
@ApiProperty({ type: () => Node })
node: Node;
```

> info **Hint** Consider using the Swagger plugin (see [Plugin](/openapi/cli-plugin) section) which will automatically detect circular dependencies.

#### Generics and interfaces

Since TypeScript does not store metadata about generics or interfaces, when you use them in your DTOs, `SwaggerModule` may not be able to properly generate model definitions at runtime. For instance, the following code won't be correctly inspected by the Swagger module:

```typescript
createBulk(@Body() usersDto: CreateUserDto[])
```

In order to overcome this limitation, you can set the type explicitly:

```typescript
@ApiBody({ type: [CreateUserDto] })
createBulk(@Body() usersDto: CreateUserDto[])
```

#### Enums

To identify an `enum`, we must manually set the `enum` property on the `@ApiProperty` with an array of values.

```typescript
@ApiProperty({ enum: ['Admin', 'Moderator', 'User']})
role: UserRole;
```

Alternatively, define an actual TypeScript enum as follows:

```typescript
export enum UserRole {
  Admin = 'Admin',
  Moderator = 'Moderator',
  User = 'User',
}
```

You can then use the enum directly with the `@Query()` parameter decorator in combination with the `@ApiQuery()` decorator.

```typescript
@ApiQuery({ name: 'role', enum: UserRole })
async filterByRole(@Query('role') role: UserRole = UserRole.User) {}
```

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/enum_query.gif" /></figure>

With `isArray` set to **true**, the `enum` can be selected as a **multi-select**:

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/enum_query_array.gif" /></figure>

#### Enums schema

By default, the `enum` property will add a raw definition of [Enum](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/enums/) on the `parameter`.

```yaml
- breed:
    type: 'string'
    enum:
      - Persian
      - Tabby
      - Siamese
```

The above specification works fine for most cases. However, if you are utilizing a tool that takes the specification as **input** and generates **client-side** code, you might run into a problem with the generated code containing duplicated `enums`. Consider the following code snippet:

```typescript
// generated client-side code
export class CatDetail {
  breed: CatDetailEnum;
}

export class CatInformation {
  breed: CatInformationEnum;
}

export enum CatDetailEnum {
  Persian = 'Persian',
  Tabby = 'Tabby',
  Siamese = 'Siamese',
}

export enum CatInformationEnum {
  Persian = 'Persian',
  Tabby = 'Tabby',
  Siamese = 'Siamese',
}
```

> info **Hint** The above snippet is generated using a tool called [NSwag](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag).

You can see that now you have two `enums` that are exactly the same.
To address this issue, you can pass an `enumName` along with the `enum` property in your decorator.

```typescript
export class CatDetail {
  @ApiProperty({ enum: CatBreed, enumName: 'CatBreed' })
  breed: CatBreed;
}
```

The `enumName` property enables `@nestjs/swagger` to turn `CatBreed` into its own `schema` which in turns makes `CatBreed` enum reusable. The specification will look like the following:

```yaml
CatDetail:
  type: 'object'
  properties:
    ...
    - breed:
        schema:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/CatBreed'
CatBreed:
  type: string
  enum:
    - Persian
    - Tabby
    - Siamese
```

> info **Hint** Any **decorator** that takes `enum` as a property will also take `enumName`.

#### Raw definitions

In some specific scenarios (e.g., deeply nested arrays, matrices), you may want to describe your type by hand.

```typescript
@ApiProperty({
  type: 'array',
  items: {
    type: 'array',
    items: {
      type: 'number',
    },
  },
})
coords: number[][];
```

Likewise, in order to define your input/output content manually in controller classes, use the `schema` property:

```typescript
@ApiBody({
  schema: {
    type: 'array',
    items: {
      type: 'array',
      items: {
        type: 'number',
      },
    },
  },
})
async create(@Body() coords: number[][]) {}
```

#### Extra models

To define additional models that should be inspected by the Swagger module, use the `@ApiExtraModels()` decorator:

```typescript
@ApiExtraModels(ExtraModel)
export class CreateCatDto {}
```

Then, you can get the reference (`$ref`) to your model using `getSchemaPath(ExtraModel)`:

```typescript
'application/vnd.api+json': {
   schema: { $ref: getSchemaPath(ExtraModel) },
},
```

#### oneOf, anyOf, allOf

To combine schemas, you can use the `oneOf`, `anyOf` or `allOf` keywords ([read more](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/oneof-anyof-allof-not/)).

```typescript
@ApiProperty({
  oneOf: [
    { $ref: getSchemaPath(Cat) },
    { $ref: getSchemaPath(Dog) },
  ],
})
pet: Cat | Dog;
```

If you want to define a polymorphic array (i.e., an array whose members span multiple schemas), you should use a raw definition (see above) to define your type by hand.

```typescript
type Pet = Cat | Dog;

@ApiProperty({
  type: 'array',
  items: {
    oneOf: [
      { $ref: getSchemaPath(Cat) },
      { $ref: getSchemaPath(Dog) },
    ],
  },
})
pets: Pet[];
```

> info **Hint** The `getSchemaPath()` function is imported from `@nestjs/swagger`.

Both `Cat` and `Dog` must be defined as extra models using the `@ApiExtraModels()` decorator (at the class-level).
### Operations <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/operations"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="operations" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

In OpenAPI terms, paths are endpoints (resources), such as `/users` or `/reports/summary`, that your API exposes, and operations are the HTTP methods used to manipulate these paths, such as `GET`, `POST` or `DELETE`.

#### Tags

To attach a controller to a specific tag, use the `@ApiTags(...tags)` decorator.

```typescript
@ApiTags('cats')
@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {}
```

#### Headers

To define custom headers that are expected as part of the request, use `@ApiHeader()`.

```typescript
@ApiHeader({
  name: 'X-MyHeader',
  description: 'Custom header',
})
@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {}
```

#### Responses

To define a custom HTTP response, use the `@ApiResponse()` decorator.

```typescript
@Post()
@ApiResponse({ status: 201, description: 'The record has been successfully created.'})
@ApiResponse({ status: 403, description: 'Forbidden.'})
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
```

Nest provides a set of short-hand **API response** decorators that inherit from the `@ApiResponse` decorator:

- `@ApiOkResponse()`
- `@ApiCreatedResponse()`
- `@ApiAcceptedResponse()`
- `@ApiNoContentResponse()`
- `@ApiMovedPermanentlyResponse()`
- `@ApiBadRequestResponse()`
- `@ApiUnauthorizedResponse()`
- `@ApiNotFoundResponse()`
- `@ApiForbiddenResponse()`
- `@ApiMethodNotAllowedResponse()`
- `@ApiNotAcceptableResponse()`
- `@ApiRequestTimeoutResponse()`
- `@ApiConflictResponse()`
- `@ApiTooManyRequestsResponse()`
- `@ApiGoneResponse()`
- `@ApiPayloadTooLargeResponse()`
- `@ApiUnsupportedMediaTypeResponse()`
- `@ApiUnprocessableEntityResponse()`
- `@ApiInternalServerErrorResponse()`
- `@ApiNotImplementedResponse()`
- `@ApiBadGatewayResponse()`
- `@ApiServiceUnavailableResponse()`
- `@ApiGatewayTimeoutResponse()`
- `@ApiDefaultResponse()`

```typescript
@Post()
@ApiCreatedResponse({ description: 'The record has been successfully created.'})
@ApiForbiddenResponse({ description: 'Forbidden.'})
async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto) {
  this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
}
```

To specify a return model for a request, we must create a class and annotate all properties with the `@ApiProperty()` decorator.

```typescript
export class Cat {
  @ApiProperty()
  id: number;

  @ApiProperty()
  name: string;

  @ApiProperty()
  age: number;

  @ApiProperty()
  breed: string;
}
```

Then the `Cat` model can be used in combination with the `type` property of the response decorator.

```typescript
@ApiTags('cats')
@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  @Post()
  @ApiCreatedResponse({
    description: 'The record has been successfully created.',
    type: Cat,
  })
  async create(@Body() createCatDto: CreateCatDto): Promise<Cat> {
    return this.catsService.create(createCatDto);
  }
}
```

Let's open the browser and verify the generated `Cat` model:

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/swagger-response-type.png" /></figure>

#### File upload

You can enable file upload for a specific method with the `@ApiBody` decorator together with `@ApiConsumes()`. Here's a full example using the [File Upload](/techniques/file-upload) technique:

```typescript
@UseInterceptors(FileInterceptor('file'))
@ApiConsumes('multipart/form-data')
@ApiBody({
  description: 'List of cats',
  type: FileUploadDto,
})
uploadFile(@UploadedFile() file) {}
```

Where `FileUploadDto` is defined as follows:

```typescript
class FileUploadDto {
  @ApiProperty({ type: 'string', format: 'binary' })
  file: any;
}
```

#### Extensions

To add an Extension to a request use the `@ApiExtension()` decorator. The extension name must be prefixed with `x-`.

```typescript
@ApiExtension('x-foo', { hello: 'world' })
```
### Security <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/security"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="security-oapi" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

To define which security mechanisms should be used for a specific operation, use the `@ApiSecurity()` decorator.

```typescript
@ApiSecurity('basic')
@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {}
```

Before you run your application, remember to add the security definition to your base document using `DocumentBuilder`:

```typescript
const options = new DocumentBuilder().addSecurity('basic', {
  type: 'http',
  scheme: 'basic',
});
```

Some of the most popular authentication techniques are built-in (e.g., `basic` and `bearer`) and therefore you don't have to define security mechanisms manually as shown above.

#### Basic authentication

To enable basic authentication, use `@ApiBasicAuth()`.

```typescript
@ApiBasicAuth()
@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {}
```

Before you run your application, remember to add the security definition to your base document using `DocumentBuilder`:

```typescript
const options = new DocumentBuilder().addBasicAuth();
```

#### Bearer authentication

To enable bearer authentication, use `@ApiBearerAuth()`.

```typescript
@ApiBearerAuth()
@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {}
```

Before you run your application, remember to add the security definition to your base document using `DocumentBuilder`:

```typescript
const options = new DocumentBuilder().addBearerAuth();
```

#### OAuth2 authentication

To enable OAuth2, use `@ApiOAuth2()`.

```typescript
@ApiOAuth2(['pets:write'])
@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {}
```

Before you run your application, remember to add the security definition to your base document using `DocumentBuilder`:

```typescript
const options = new DocumentBuilder().addOAuth2();
```

#### Cookie authentication

To enable cookie authentication, use `@ApiCookieAuth()`.

```typescript
@ApiCookieAuth()
@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {}
```

Before you run your application, remember to add the security definition to your base document using `DocumentBuilder`:

```typescript
const options = new DocumentBuilder().addCookieAuth('optional-session-id');
```
### Mapped types <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/mapped-types"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="mapped-types-oapi" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

As you build out features like **CRUD** (Create/Read/Update/Delete) it's often useful to construct variants on a base entity type. Nest provides several utility functions that perform type transformations to make this task more convenient.

#### Partial

When building input validation types (also called DTOs), it's often useful to build **create** and **update** variations on the same type. For example, the **create** variant may require all fields, while the **update** variant may make all fields optional.

Nest provides the `PartialType()` utility function to make this task easier and minimize boilerplate.

The `PartialType()` function returns a type (class) with all the properties of the input type set to optional. For example, suppose we have a **create** type as follows:

```typescript
import { ApiProperty } from '@nestjs/swagger';

export class CreateCatDto {
  @ApiProperty()
  name: string;

  @ApiProperty()
  age: number;

  @ApiProperty()
  breed: string;
}
```

By default, all of these fields are required. To create a type with the same fields, but with each one optional, use `PartialType()` passing the class reference (`CreateCatDto`) as an argument:

```typescript
export class UpdateCatDto extends PartialType(CreateCatDto) {}
```

> info **Hint** The `PartialType()` function is imported from the `@nestjs/swagger` package.

#### Pick

The `PickType()` function constructs a new type (class) by picking a set of properties from an input type. For example, suppose we start with a type like:

```typescript
import { ApiProperty } from '@nestjs/swagger';

export class CreateCatDto {
  @ApiProperty()
  name: string;

  @ApiProperty()
  age: number;

  @ApiProperty()
  breed: string;
}
```

We can pick a set of properties from this class using the `PickType()` utility function:

```typescript
export class UpdateCatAgeDto extends PickType(CreateCatDto, ['age'] as const) {}
```

> info **Hint** The `PickType()` function is imported from the `@nestjs/swagger` package.

#### Omit

The `OmitType()` function constructs a type by picking all properties from an input type and then removing a particular set of keys. For example, suppose we start with a type like:

```typescript
import { ApiProperty } from '@nestjs/swagger';

export class CreateCatDto {
  @ApiProperty()
  name: string;

  @ApiProperty()
  age: number;

  @ApiProperty()
  breed: string;
}
```

We can generate a derived type that has every property **except** `name` as shown below. In this construct, the second argument to `OmitType` is an array of property names.

```typescript
export class UpdateCatDto extends OmitType(CreateCatDto, ['name'] as const) {}
```

> info **Hint** The `OmitType()` function is imported from the `@nestjs/swagger` package.

#### Intersection

The `IntersectionType()` function combines two types into one new type (class). For example, suppose we start with two types like:

```typescript
import { ApiProperty } from '@nestjs/swagger';

export class CreateCatDto {
  @ApiProperty()
  name: string;

  @ApiProperty()
  breed: string;
}

export class AdditionalCatInfo {
  @ApiProperty()
  color: string;
}
```

We can generate a new type that combines all properties in both types.

```typescript
export class UpdateCatDto extends IntersectionType(
  CreateCatDto,
  AdditionalCatInfo,
) {}
```

> info **Hint** The `IntersectionType()` function is imported from the `@nestjs/swagger` package.

#### Composition

The type mapping utility functions are composable. For example, the following will produce a type (class) that has all of the properties of the `CreateCatDto` type except for `name`, and those properties will be set to optional:

```typescript
export class UpdateCatDto extends PartialType(
  OmitType(CreateCatDto, ['name'] as const),
) {}
```
### Decorators <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/decorators"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="decorators" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

All of the available OpenAPI decorators have an `Api` prefix to distinguish them from the core decorators. Below is a full list of the exported decorators along with a designation of the level at which the decorator may be applied.

|                          |                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| `@ApiOperation()`        | Method              |
| `@ApiResponse()`         | Method / Controller |
| `@ApiProduces()`         | Method / Controller |
| `@ApiConsumes()`         | Method / Controller |
| `@ApiBearerAuth()`       | Method / Controller |
| `@ApiOAuth2()`           | Method / Controller |
| `@ApiBasicAuth()`        | Method / Controller |
| `@ApiSecurity()`         | Method / Controller |
| `@ApiExtraModels()`      | Method / Controller |
| `@ApiBody()`             | Method              |
| `@ApiParam()`            | Method              |
| `@ApiQuery()`            | Method              |
| `@ApiHeader()`           | Method / Controller |
| `@ApiExcludeEndpoint()`  | Method              |
| `@ApiTags()`             | Method / Controller |
| `@ApiProperty()`         | Model               |
| `@ApiPropertyOptional()` | Model               |
| `@ApiHideProperty()`     | Model               |
| `@ApiExtension()`        | Method              |

### CLI Plugin <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/cli-plugin"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="cli-plugin-oapi" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

TypeScript's metadata reflection system has several limitations which make it impossible to, for instance, determine what properties a class consists of or recognize whether a given property is optional or required. However, some of these constraints can be addressed at compilation time. Nest provides a plugin that enhances the TypeScript compilation process to reduce the amount of boilerplate code required.

> warning **Hint** This plugin is **opt-in**. If you prefer, you can declare all decorators manually, or only specific decorators where you need them.

#### Overview

The Swagger plugin will automatically:

- annotate all DTO properties with `@ApiProperty` unless `@ApiHideProperty` is used
- set the `required` property depending on the question mark (e.g. `name?: string` will set `required: false`)
- set the `type` or `enum` property depending on the type (supports arrays as well)
- set the `default` property based on the assigned default value
- set several validation rules based on `class-validator` decorators (if `classValidatorShim` set to `true`)
- add a response decorator to every endpoint with a proper status and `type` (response model)

Please, note that your filenames **must have** one of the following suffixes: `['.dto.ts', '.entity.ts']` (e.g., `create-user.dto.ts`) in order to be analysed by the plugin.

If you are using a different suffix, you can adjust the plugin's behavior by specifying the `dtoFileNameSuffix` option (see below).

Previously, if you wanted to provide an interactive experience with the Swagger UI,
you had to duplicate a lot of code to let the package know how your models/components should be declared in the specification. For example, you could define a simple `CreateUserDto` class as follows:

```typescript
export class CreateUserDto {
  @ApiProperty()
  email: string;

  @ApiProperty()
  password: string;

  @ApiProperty({ enum: RoleEnum, default: [], isArray: true })
  roles: RoleEnum[] = [];

  @ApiProperty({ required: false, default: true })
  isEnabled?: boolean = true;
}
```

While not a significant issue with medium-sized projects, it becomes verbose & hard to maintain once you have a large set of classes.

By enabling the Swagger plugin, the above class definition can be declared simply:

```typescript
export class CreateUserDto {
  email: string;
  password: string;
  roles: RoleEnum[] = [];
  isEnabled?: boolean = true;
}
```

The plugin adds appropriate decorators on the fly based on the **Abstract Syntax Tree**. Thus you won't have to struggle with `@ApiProperty` decorators scattered throughout the code.

> warning **Hint** The plugin will automatically generate any missing swagger properties, but if you need to override them, you simply set them explicitly via `@ApiProperty()`.

#### Using the CLI plugin

To enable the plugin, open `nest-cli.json` (if you use [Nest CLI](/cli/overview)) and add the following `plugins` configuration:

```javascript
{
  "collection": "@nestjs/schematics",
  "sourceRoot": "src",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": ["@nestjs/swagger/plugin"]
  }
}
```

You can use the `options` property to customize the behavior of the plugin.

```javascript
"plugins": [
  {
    "name": "@nestjs/swagger/plugin",
    "options": {
      "classValidatorShim": false
    }
  }
]
```

The `options` property has to fulfill the following interface:

```typescript
export interface PluginOptions {
  dtoFileNameSuffix?: string[];
  controllerFileNameSuffix?: string[];
  classValidatorShim?: boolean;
}
```

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Option</th>
    <th>Default</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>dtoFileNameSuffix</code></td>
    <td><code>['.dto.ts', '.entity.ts']</code></td>
    <td>DTO (Data Transfer Object) files suffix</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>controllerFileNameSuffix</code></td>
    <td><code>.controller.ts</code></td>
    <td>Controller files suffix</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>classValidatorShim</code></td>
    <td><code>true</code></td>
    <td>If set to true, the module will reuse <code>class-validator</code> validation decorators (e.g. <code>@Max(10)</code> will add <code>max: 10</code> to schema definition) </td>
  </tr>
</table>

If you don't use the CLI but instead have a custom `webpack` configuration, you can use this plugin in combination with `ts-loader`:

```javascript
getCustomTransformers: (program: any) => ({
  before: [require('@nestjs/swagger/plugin').before({}, program)]
}),
```
### Other features <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/other-features"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="other-features-oapi" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

#### Global prefix

To ignore a global prefix for routes set through `setGlobalPrefix()`, use `ignoreGlobalPrefix`:

```typescript
const document = SwaggerModule.createDocument(app, options, {
  ignoreGlobalPrefix: true,
});
```

#### Multiple specifications

The `SwaggerModule` provides a way to support multiple specifications. In other words, you can serve different documentation, with different UIs, on different endpoints.

To support multiple specifications, your application must be written with a modular approach. The `createDocument()` method takes a 3rd argument, `extraOptions`, which is an object with a property named `include`. The `include` property takes a value which is an array of modules.

You can setup multiple specifications support as shown below:

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { SwaggerModule, DocumentBuilder } from '@nestjs/swagger';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

  /**
   * createDocument(application, configurationOptions, extraOptions);
   *
   * createDocument method takes an optional 3rd argument "extraOptions"
   * which is an object with "include" property where you can pass an Array
   * of Modules that you want to include in that Swagger Specification
   * E.g: CatsModule and DogsModule will have two separate Swagger Specifications which
   * will be exposed on two different SwaggerUI with two different endpoints.
   */

  const options = new DocumentBuilder()
    .setTitle('Cats example')
    .setDescription('The cats API description')
    .setVersion('1.0')
    .addTag('cats')
    .build();

  const catDocument = SwaggerModule.createDocument(app, options, {
    include: [CatsModule],
  });
  SwaggerModule.setup('api/cats', app, catDocument);

  const secondOptions = new DocumentBuilder()
    .setTitle('Dogs example')
    .setDescription('The dogs API description')
    .setVersion('1.0')
    .addTag('dogs')
    .build();

  const dogDocument = SwaggerModule.createDocument(app, secondOptions, {
    include: [DogsModule],
  });
  SwaggerModule.setup('api/dogs', app, dogDocument);

  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

Now you can start your server with the following command:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/cats` to see the Swagger UI for cats:

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/swagger-cats.png" /></figure>

In turn, `http://localhost:3000/api/dogs` will expose the Swagger UI for dogs:

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/swagger-dogs.png" /></figure>

### Migration guide <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/migration-guide"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="migration-guide-oapi" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

If you're currently using `@nestjs/swagger@3.*`, note the following breaking/API changes in version 4.0.

### SQL (TypeORM) <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/sql-typeorm"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="sql-typeorm" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

##### This chapter applies only to TypeScript

> **Warning** In this article, you'll learn how to create a `DatabaseModule` based on the **TypeORM** package from scratch using custom providers mechanism. As a consequence, this solution contains a lot of overhead that you can omit using ready to use and available out-of-the-box dedicated `@nestjs/typeorm` package. To learn more, see [here](/techniques/sql).

[TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) is definitely the most mature Object Relational Mapper (ORM) available in the node.js world. Since it's written in TypeScript, it works pretty well with the Nest framework.

#### Getting started

To start the adventure with this library we have to install all required dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install --save typeorm mysql
```

The first step we need to do is to establish the connection with our database using `createConnection()` function imported from the `typeorm` package. The `createConnection()` function returns a `Promise`, and therefore we have to create an [async provider](/fundamentals/async-components).

```typescript
@@filename(database.providers)
import { createConnection } from 'typeorm';

export const databaseProviders = [
  {
    provide: 'DATABASE_CONNECTION',
    useFactory: async () => await createConnection({
      type: 'mysql',
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 3306,
      username: 'root',
      password: 'root',
      database: 'test',
      entities: [
          __dirname + '/../**/*.entity{.ts,.js}',
      ],
      synchronize: true,
    }),
  },
];
```

> warning **Hint** Following best practices, we declared the custom provider in the separated file which has a `*.providers.ts` suffix.

Then, we need to export these providers to make them **accessible** for the rest of the application.

```typescript
@@filename(database.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { databaseProviders } from './database.providers';

@Module({
  providers: [...databaseProviders],
  exports: [...databaseProviders],
})
export class DatabaseModule {}
```

Now we can inject the `Connection` object using `@Inject()` decorator. Each class that would depend on the `Connection` async provider will wait until a `Promise` is resolved.

#### Repository pattern

The [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) supports the repository design pattern, thus each entity has its own Repository. These repositories can be obtained from the database connection.

But firstly, we need at least one entity. We are going to reuse the `Photo` entity from the official documentation.

```typescript
@@filename(photo.entity)
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
export class Photo {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column({ length: 500 })
  name: string;

  @Column('text')
  description: string;

  @Column()
  filename: string;

  @Column('int')
  views: number;

  @Column()
  isPublished: boolean;
}
```

The `Photo` entity belongs to the `photo` directory. This directory represents the `PhotoModule`. Now, let's create a **Repository** provider:

```typescript
@@filename(photo.providers)
import { Connection, Repository } from 'typeorm';
import { Photo } from './photo.entity';

export const photoProviders = [
  {
    provide: 'PHOTO_REPOSITORY',
    useFactory: (connection: Connection) => connection.getRepository(Photo),
    inject: ['DATABASE_CONNECTION'],
  },
];
```

> warning **Notice** In the real-world applications you should avoid **magic strings**. Both `PHOTO_REPOSITORY` and `DATABASE_CONNECTION` should be kept in the separated `constants.ts` file.

Now we can inject the `Repository<Photo>` to the `PhotoService` using the `@Inject()` decorator:

```typescript
@@filename(photo.service)
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Repository } from 'typeorm';
import { Photo } from './photo.entity';

@Injectable()
export class PhotoService {
  constructor(
    @Inject('PHOTO_REPOSITORY')
    private photoRepository: Repository<Photo>,
  ) {}

  async findAll(): Promise<Photo[]> {
    return this.photoRepository.find();
  }
}
```

The database connection is **asynchronous**, but Nest makes this process completely invisible for the end-user. The `PhotoRepository` is waiting for the db connection, and the `PhotoService` is delayed until repository is ready to use. The entire application can start when each class is instantiated.

Here is a final `PhotoModule`:

```typescript
@@filename(photo.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { DatabaseModule } from '../database/database.module';
import { photoProviders } from './photo.providers';
import { PhotoService } from './photo.service';

@Module({
  imports: [DatabaseModule],
  providers: [
    ...photoProviders,
    PhotoService,
  ],
})
export class PhotoModule {}
```

> warning **Hint** Do not forget to import the `PhotoModule` into the root `ApplicationModule`.
### MongoDB (Mongoose) <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/mongodb"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="mongodb" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

> **Warning** In this article, you'll learn how to create a `DatabaseModule` based on the **Mongoose** package from scratch using custom components. As a consequence, this solution contains a lot of overhead that you can omit using ready to use and available out-of-the-box dedicated `@nestjs/mongoose` package. To learn more, see [here](/techniques/mongodb).

[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) is the most popular [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) object modeling tool.

#### Getting started

To start the adventure with this library we have to install all required dependencies:

```typescript
@@filename()
$ npm install --save mongoose
$ npm install --save-dev @types/mongoose
@@switch
$ npm install --save mongoose
```

The first step we need to do is to establish the connection with our database using `connect()` function. The `connect()` function returns a `Promise`, and therefore we have to create an [async provider](/fundamentals/async-components).

```typescript
@@filename(database.providers)
import * as mongoose from 'mongoose';

export const databaseProviders = [
  {
    provide: 'DATABASE_CONNECTION',
    useFactory: (): Promise<typeof mongoose> =>
      mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/nest'),
  },
];
@@switch
import * as mongoose from 'mongoose';

export const databaseProviders = [
  {
    provide: 'DATABASE_CONNECTION',
    useFactory: () => mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/nest'),
  },
];
```

> info **Hint** Following best practices, we declared the custom provider in the separated file which has a `*.providers.ts` suffix.

Then, we need to export these providers to make them **accessible** for the rest part of the application.

```typescript
@@filename(database.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { databaseProviders } from './database.providers';

@Module({
  providers: [...databaseProviders],
  exports: [...databaseProviders],
})
export class DatabaseModule {}
```

Now we can inject the `Connection` object using `@Inject()` decorator. Each class that would depend on the `Connection` async provider will wait until a `Promise` is resolved.

#### Model injection

With Mongoose, everything is derived from a [Schema](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html). Let's define the `CatSchema`:

```typescript
@@filename(schemas/cat.schema)
import * as mongoose from 'mongoose';

export const CatSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
  breed: String,
});
```

The `CatsSchema` belongs to the `cats` directory. This directory represents the `CatsModule`.

Now it's time to create a **Model** provider:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.providers)
import { Connection } from 'mongoose';
import { CatSchema } from './schemas/cat.schema';

export const catsProviders = [
  {
    provide: 'CAT_MODEL',
    useFactory: (connection: Connection) => connection.model('Cat', CatSchema),
    inject: ['DATABASE_CONNECTION'],
  },
];
@@switch
import { CatSchema } from './schemas/cat.schema';

export const catsProviders = [
  {
    provide: 'CAT_MODEL',
    useFactory: (connection) => connection.model('Cat', CatSchema),
    inject: ['DATABASE_CONNECTION'],
  },
];
```

> **Notice** In the real-world applications you should avoid **magic strings**. Both `CAT_MODEL` and `DATABASE_CONNECTION` should be kept in the separated `constants.ts` file.

Now we can inject the `CAT_MODEL` to the `CatsService` using the `@Inject()` decorator:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.service)
import { Model } from 'mongoose';
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Cat } from './interfaces/cat.interface';
import { CreateCatDto } from './dto/create-cat.dto';

@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  constructor(
    @Inject('CAT_MODEL')
    private catModel: Model<Cat>,
  ) {}

  async create(createCatDto: CreateCatDto): Promise<Cat> {
    const createdCat = new this.catModel(createCatDto);
    return createdCat.save();
  }

  async findAll(): Promise<Cat[]> {
    return this.catModel.find().exec();
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable, Dependencies } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
@Dependencies('CAT_MODEL')
export class CatsService {
  constructor(catModel) {
    this.catModel = catModel;
  }

  async create(createCatDto) {
    const createdCat = new this.catModel(createCatDto);
    return createdCat.save();
  }

  async findAll() {
    return this.catModel.find().exec();
  }
}
```

In the above example we have used the `Cat` interface. This interface extends the `Document` from the mongoose package:

```typescript
import { Document } from 'mongoose';

export interface Cat extends Document {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly age: number;
  readonly breed: string;
}
```

The database connection is **asynchronous**, but Nest makes this process completely invisible for the end-user. The `CatModel` class is waiting for the db connection, and the `CatsService` is delayed until model is ready to use. The entire application can start when each class is instantiated.

Here is a final `CatsModule`:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsController } from './cats.controller';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';
import { catsProviders } from './cats.providers';
import { DatabaseModule } from '../database/database.module';

@Module({
  imports: [DatabaseModule],
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [
    CatsService,
    ...catsProviders,
  ],
})
export class CatsModule {}
```

> warning **Hint** Do not forget to import the `CatsModule` into the root `ApplicationModule`.
### SQL (Sequelize) <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/sql-sequelize"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="sql-sequelize" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

##### This chapter applies only to TypeScript

> **Warning** In this article, you'll learn how to create a `DatabaseModule` based on the **Sequelize** package from scratch using custom components. As a consequence, this technique contains a lot of overhead that you can avoid by using the dedicated, out-of-the-box `@nestjs/sequelize` package. To learn more, see [here](/techniques/database#sequelize-integration).

[Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) is a popular Object Relational Mapper (ORM) written in a vanilla JavaScript, but there is a [sequelize-typescript](https://github.com/RobinBuschmann/sequelize-typescript) TypeScript wrapper which provides a set of decorators and other extras for the base sequelize.

#### Getting started

To start the adventure with this library we have to install the following dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install --save sequelize sequelize-typescript mysql2
$ npm install --save-dev @types/sequelize
```

The first step we need to do is create a **Sequelize** instance with an options object passed into the constructor. Also, we need to add all models (the alternative is to use `modelPaths` property) and `sync()` our database tables.

```typescript
@@filename(database.providers)
import { Sequelize } from 'sequelize-typescript';
import { Cat } from '../cats/cat.entity';

export const databaseProviders = [
  {
    provide: 'SEQUELIZE',
    useFactory: async () => {
      const sequelize = new Sequelize({
        dialect: 'mysql',
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 3306,
        username: 'root',
        password: 'password',
        database: 'nest',
      });
      sequelize.addModels([Cat]);
      await sequelize.sync();
      return sequelize;
    },
  },
];
```

> warning **Hint** Following best practices, we declared the custom provider in the separated file which has a `*.providers.ts` suffix.

Then, we need to export these providers to make them **accessible** for the rest part of the application.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { databaseProviders } from './database.providers';

@Module({
  providers: [...databaseProviders],
  exports: [...databaseProviders],
})
export class DatabaseModule {}
```

Now we can inject the `Sequelize` object using `@Inject()` decorator. Each class that would depend on the `Sequelize` async provider will wait until a `Promise` is resolved.

#### Model injection

In [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) the **Model** defines a table in the database. Instances of this class represent a database row. Firstly, we need at least one entity:

```typescript
@@filename(cat.entity)
import { Table, Column, Model } from 'sequelize-typescript';

@Table
export class Cat extends Model<Cat> {
  @Column
  name: string;

  @Column
  age: number;

  @Column
  breed: string;
}
```

The `Cat` entity belongs to the `cats` directory. This directory represents the `CatsModule`. Now it's time to create a **Repository** provider:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.providers)
import { Cat } from './cat.entity';

export const catsProviders = [
  {
    provide: 'CATS_REPOSITORY',
    useValue: Cat,
  },
];
```

> **Notice** In the real-world applications you should avoid **magic strings**. Both `CATS_REPOSITORY` and `SEQUELIZE` should be kept in the separated `constants.ts` file.

In Sequelize, we use static methods to manipulate the data, and thus we created an **alias** here.

Now we can inject the `CATS_REPOSITORY` to the `CatsService` using the `@Inject()` decorator:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.service)
import { Injectable, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CreateCatDto } from './dto/create-cat.dto';
import { Cat } from './cat.entity';

@Injectable()
export class CatsService {
  constructor(
    @Inject('CATS_REPOSITORY') private catsRepository: typeof Cat) {}

  async findAll(): Promise<Cat[]> {
    return this.catsRepository.findAll<Cat>();
  }
}
```

The database connection is **asynchronous**, but Nest makes this process completely invisible for the end-user. The `CATS_REPOSITORY` provider is waiting for the db connection, and the `CatsService` is delayed until repository is ready to use. The entire application can start when each class is instantiated.

Here is a final `CatsModule`:

```typescript
@@filename(cats.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CatsController } from './cats.controller';
import { CatsService } from './cats.service';
import { catsProviders } from './cats.providers';
import { DatabaseModule } from '../database/database.module';

@Module({
  imports: [DatabaseModule],
  controllers: [CatsController],
  providers: [
    CatsService,
    ...catsProviders,
  ],
})
export class CatsModule {}
```

> warning **Hint** Do not forget to import the `CatsModule` into the root `ApplicationModule`.


### OpenAPI (Swagger) <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/swagger"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="swagger" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

[OPENAPI (Swagger)](./Openapi.md)  have is own section in this documentation please look at [Openapi.md](./Openapi.md)


### CQRS <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/cqrs"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="cqrs" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

The flow of simple [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) (Create, Read, Update and Delete) applications can be described using the following steps:

1.  The **controllers** layer handles HTTP requests and delegates tasks to the services layer.
2.  The **services layer** is where most of the business logic lives.
3.  Services uses **repositories / DAOs** to change / persist entities.
4.  Entities act as containers for the values, with setters and getters.

In most cases, for small and medium-sized applications, this pattern is sufficient. However, when our requirements become more complex, the **CQRS** model may be more appropriate and scalable. To facilitate that model, Nest provides a lightweight [CQRS module](https://github.com/nestjs/cqrs). This chapter describes how to use it.

#### Installation

First install the required package:

```bash
$ npm install --save @nestjs/cqrs
```

#### Commands

In this model, each action is called a **Command**. When a command is dispatched, the application reacts to it. Commands can be dispatched from the services layer, or directly from controllers/gateways. Commands are consumed by **Command Handlers**.

```typescript
@@filename(heroes-game.service)
@Injectable()
export class HeroesGameService {
  constructor(private commandBus: CommandBus) {}

  async killDragon(heroId: string, killDragonDto: KillDragonDto) {
    return this.commandBus.execute(
      new KillDragonCommand(heroId, killDragonDto.dragonId)
    );
  }
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
@Dependencies(CommandBus)
export class HeroesGameService {
  constructor(commandBus) {
    this.commandBus = commandBus;
  }

  async killDragon(heroId, killDragonDto) {
    return this.commandBus.execute(
      new KillDragonCommand(heroId, killDragonDto.dragonId)
    );
  }
}
```

Here's a sample service that dispatches `KillDragonCommand`. Let's see how the command looks:

```typescript
@@filename(kill-dragon.command)
export class KillDragonCommand {
  constructor(
    public readonly heroId: string,
    public readonly dragonId: string,
  ) {}
}
@@switch
export class KillDragonCommand {
  constructor(heroId, dragonId) {
    this.heroId = heroId;
    this.dragonId = dragonId;
  }
}
```

The `CommandBus` is a **stream** of commands. It delegates commands to the equivalent handlers. Each command must have a corresponding **Command Handler**:

```typescript
@@filename(kill-dragon.handler)
@CommandHandler(KillDragonCommand)
export class KillDragonHandler implements ICommandHandler<KillDragonCommand> {
  constructor(private repository: HeroRepository) {}

  async execute(command: KillDragonCommand) {
    const { heroId, dragonId } = command;
    const hero = this.repository.findOneById(+heroId);

    hero.killEnemy(dragonId);
    await this.repository.persist(hero);
  }
}
@@switch
@CommandHandler(KillDragonCommand)
@Dependencies(HeroRepository)
export class KillDragonHandler {
  constructor(repository) {
    this.repository = repository;
  }

  async execute(command) {
    const { heroId, dragonId } = command;
    const hero = this.repository.findOneById(+heroId);

    hero.killEnemy(dragonId);
    await this.repository.persist(hero);
  }
}
```

With this approach, every application state change is driven by the occurrence of a **Command**. The logic is encapsulated in handlers. With this approach, we can simply add behavior like logging or persisting commands in the database (e.g., for diagnostics purposes).

#### Events

Command handlers neatly encapsulate logic. While beneficial, the application structure is still not flexible enough, not **reactive**. To remedy this, we also introduce **events**.

```typescript
@@filename(hero-killed-dragon.event)
export class HeroKilledDragonEvent {
  constructor(
    public readonly heroId: string,
    public readonly dragonId: string,
  ) {}
}
@@switch
export class HeroKilledDragonEvent {
  constructor(heroId, dragonId) {
    this.heroId = heroId;
    this.dragonId = dragonId;
  }
}
```

Events are asynchronous. They are dispatched either by **models** or directly using `EventBus`. In order to dispatch events, models have to extend the `AggregateRoot` class.

```typescript
@@filename(hero.model)
export class Hero extends AggregateRoot {
  constructor(private id: string) {
    super();
  }

  killEnemy(enemyId: string) {
    // logic
    this.apply(new HeroKilledDragonEvent(this.id, enemyId));
  }
}
@@switch
export class Hero extends AggregateRoot {
  constructor(id) {
    super();
    this.id = id;
  }

  killEnemy(enemyId) {
    // logic
    this.apply(new HeroKilledDragonEvent(this.id, enemyId));
  }
}
```

The `apply()` method does not dispatch events yet because there's no relationship between the model and the `EventPublisher` class. How do we associate the model and the publisher? By using a publisher `mergeObjectContext()` method inside our command handler.

```typescript
@@filename(kill-dragon.handler)
@CommandHandler(KillDragonCommand)
export class KillDragonHandler implements ICommandHandler<KillDragonCommand> {
  constructor(
    private repository: HeroRepository,
    private publisher: EventPublisher,
  ) {}

  async execute(command: KillDragonCommand) {
    const { heroId, dragonId } = command;
    const hero = this.publisher.mergeObjectContext(
      await this.repository.findOneById(+heroId),
    );
    hero.killEnemy(dragonId);
    hero.commit();
  }
}
@@switch
@CommandHandler(KillDragonCommand)
@Dependencies(HeroRepository, EventPublisher)
export class KillDragonHandler {
  constructor(repository, publisher) {
    this.repository = repository;
    this.publisher = publisher;
  }

  async execute(command) {
    const { heroId, dragonId } = command;
    const hero = this.publisher.mergeObjectContext(
      await this.repository.findOneById(+heroId),
    );
    hero.killEnemy(dragonId);
    hero.commit();
  }
}
```

Now everything works as expected. Notice that we need to `commit()` events since they're not being dispatched immediately. Obviously, an object doesn't have to exist up front. We can easily merge type context as well:

```typescript
const HeroModel = this.publisher.mergeContext(Hero);
new HeroModel('id');
```

Now the model has the ability to publish events. Additionally, we can emit events manually using `EventBus`:

```typescript
this.eventBus.publish(new HeroKilledDragonEvent());
```

> info **Hint** The `EventBus` is an injectable class.

Each event can have multiple **Event Handlers**.

```typescript
@@filename(hero-killed-dragon.handler)
@EventsHandler(HeroKilledDragonEvent)
export class HeroKilledDragonHandler implements IEventHandler<HeroKilledDragonEvent> {
  constructor(private repository: HeroRepository) {}

  handle(event: HeroKilledDragonEvent) {
    // logic
  }
}
```

Now we can move the **write logic** into the event handlers.

#### Sagas

This type of **Event-Driven Architecture** improves application **reactiveness and scalability**. Now, when we have events, we can simply react to them in various ways. **Sagas** are the final building block from an architectural point of view.

Sagas are an extremely powerful feature. A single saga may listen for 1..\* events. Using the [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) library, it can combine, merge, filter or apply other `RxJS` operators on the event stream. Each saga returns an Observable which contains a command. This command is dispatched **asynchronously**.

```typescript
@@filename(heroes-game.saga)
@Injectable()
export class HeroesGameSagas {
  @Saga()
  dragonKilled = (events$: Observable<any>): Observable<ICommand> => {
    return events$.pipe(
      ofType(HeroKilledDragonEvent),
      map((event) => new DropAncientItemCommand(event.heroId, fakeItemID)),
    );
  }
}
@@switch
@Injectable()
export class HeroesGameSagas {
  @Saga()
  dragonKilled = (events$) => {
    return events$.pipe(
      ofType(HeroKilledDragonEvent),
      map((event) => new DropAncientItemCommand(event.heroId, fakeItemID)),
    );
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** The `ofType` operator is exported from the `@nestjs/cqrs` package.

We declared a rule - when any hero kills the dragon, the ancient item should be dropped. With this in place, `DropAncientItemCommand` will be dispatched and processed by the appropriate handler.

#### Queries

The `CqrsModule` can also be used for handling queries. The `QueryBus` follows the same pattern as the `CommandsBus`. Query handlers should implement the `IQueryHandler` interface and be marked with the `@QueryHandler()` decorator.

#### Setup

Finally, let's look at how to set up the whole CQRS mechanism.

```typescript
@@filename(heroes-game.module)
export const CommandHandlers = [KillDragonHandler, DropAncientItemHandler];
export const EventHandlers =  [HeroKilledDragonHandler, HeroFoundItemHandler];

@Module({
  imports: [CqrsModule],
  controllers: [HeroesGameController],
  providers: [
    HeroesGameService,
    HeroesGameSagas,
    ...CommandHandlers,
    ...EventHandlers,
    HeroRepository,
  ]
})
export class HeroesGameModule {}
```

#### Summary

`CommandBus`, `QueryBus` and `EventBus` are **Observables**. This means that you can easily subscribe to the whole stream and enrich your application with **Event Sourcing**.

A working example is available [here](https://github.com/kamilmysliwiec/nest-cqrs-example).
### Prisma <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/prisma"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="prisma" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) is an [open-source](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) database toolkit. You can use it to query data from a database inside a Node.js or TypeScript application. Prisma and NestJS go great together since you can use Prisma in your services to fulfill the data needs from your controllers.

Prisma is used as an **alternative** to writing plain SQL, or using another database access tool such as SQL query builders (like [knex.js](https://knexjs.org/)) or ORMs (like [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) and [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)). Prisma currently supports PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite.

While Prisma is a toolkit that contains multiple tools, the focus of this guide will be on using [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client). Prisma Client is an auto-generated and type-safe query builder that lets you read and write data in your database.

> info **Note** If you want to get a quick overview of how Prisma works, you can follow the [Quickstart](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart) or read the [Introduction](https://www.prisma.io/docs/understand-prisma/introduction) in the [documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/).

#### Getting started

In this recipe, you'll learn how to get started with NestJS and Prisma from scratch. You are going to build a sample NestJS application with a REST API that can read and write data in a database.

For the purpose of this guide, you'll use a [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) database to save the overhead of setting up a database server. Note that you can still follow this guide, even if you're using PostgreSQL or MySQL ‚Äì you'll get extra instructions for using these databases at the right places.

#### Create your NestJS project

To get started, install the NestJS CLI and create your app skeleton with the following commands:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/cli
$ nest new hello-prisma
```

See the [First steps](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps) page to learn more about the project files created by this command. Note also that you can now run `npm start` to start your application. The REST API running at `http://localhost:3000/` currently serves a single route that's implemented in `src/app.controller.ts`. Over the course of this guide, you'll implement additional routes to store and retrieve data about _users_ and _posts_.

#### Set up Prisma

Start by installing the Prisma CLI as a development dependency in your project:

```bash
$ npm install @prisma/cli --save-dev
```

In the following steps, we'll be utilizing the [Prisma CLI](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-cli). As a best practice, it's recommended to invoke the CLI locally by prefixing it with `npx`:

```bash
$ npx prisma
```

<details><summary>Expand if you're using Yarn</summary>

If you're using Yarn, then you can install the Prisma CLI as follows:

```bash
$ yarn add @prisma/cli --dev
```

Once installed, you can invoke it by prefixing it with `yarn`:

```bash
$ yarn prisma
```

</details>

Now create your initial Prisma setup using the `init` command of the Prisma CLI:

```bash
$ npx prisma init
```

This command creates a new `prisma` directory with the following contents:

- `schema.prisma`: Specifies your database connection and contains the database schema
- `.env`: A [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) file, typically used to store your database credentials in a group of environment variables

#### Create your SQLite database file and set the database connection

SQLite databases are simple files; no server is required to use a SQLite database. You can therefore create a new SQLite database by manually creating a new file on your file system.

Navigate into the new `prisma` directory and create a file called `dev.db` inside of it.

Next, open up `schema.prisma` and adjust the `provider` field of the `datasource` block to `sqlite`:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

Now, open up `.env` and adjust the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to look as follows:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

<details><summary>Expand if you're using PostgreSQL or MySQL</summary>

**PostgreSQL**

If you're using PostgreSQL, you have to adjust the `schema.prisma` and `.env` files as follows:

**`schema.prisma`**

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

**`.env`**

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=SCHEMA"
```

Replace the placeholders spelled in all uppercase letters with your database credentials. Note that if you're unsure what to provide for the `SCHEMA` placeholder, it's most likely the default value `public`:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"
```

If you want to learn how to set up a PostgreSQL database, you can follow this guide on [setting up a free PostgreSQL database on Heroku](https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1).

**MySQL**

If you're using MySQL, you have to adjust the `schema.prisma` and `.env` files as follows:

**`schema.prisma`**

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}
```

**`.env`**

```bash
DATABASE_URL="mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
```

Replace the placeholders spelled in all uppercase letters with your database credentials.

#### Create two database tables

In this section, you'll create two new tables in your database. Run the following SQL statements in your terminal:

**Mac OS / Linux**

```bash
$ sqlite3 dev.db \
'CREATE TABLE "User" (
  "id"    INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  "name"  TEXT,
  "email" TEXT    NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
CREATE TABLE "Post" (
  "id"        INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  "title"     TEXT    NOT NULL,
  "content"   TEXT,
  "published" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  "authorId"  INTEGER REFERENCES "User"(id)
);
'
```

**Windows**

```bash
$ sqlite3 ./prisma/dev.db
CREATE TABLE "User" (
  "id"    INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  "name"  TEXT,
  "email" TEXT    NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
CREATE TABLE "Post" (
  "id"        INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  "title"     TEXT    NOT NULL,
  "content"   TEXT,
  "published" BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  "authorId"  INTEGER REFERENCES "User"(id)
);
```

Note that Prisma also features a **schema migration** tool called [Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-migrate). Prisma Migrate lets you manually define your models in your Prisma schema and takes care of creating the tables in your database. Because Prisma Migrate is currently considered experimental, this guide uses an alternative workflow of using plain SQL to create your database tables and generate Prisma models via [introspection](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/introspection).

#### Introspect your database to obtain your Prisma models in the Prisma schema

Now that you've created your database tables, you can **introspect** the database to generate your [Prisma models](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/models). After that, you will install and generate Prisma Client, which will expose queries that are tailored to these models.

To introspect your database, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ npx prisma introspect
```

This reads your SQL schema and translates each table into a corresponding Prisma model. Your `schema.prisma` file now looks as follows:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model User {
  email String  @unique
  id    Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  name  String?
  Post  Post[]
}

model Post {
  authorId  Int?
  content   String?
  id        Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id
  published Boolean? @default(false)
  title     String
  User      User?    @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
}
```

With your Prisma models in place, you can install and generate Prisma Client.

#### Install and generate Prisma Client

To install Prisma Client in your project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ npm install @prisma/client
```

Note that during installation, Prisma automatically invokes the `prisma generate` command for you. In the future, you need to run this command after _every_ change to your Prisma models to update your generated Prisma Client.

> info **Note** The `prisma generate` command reads your Prisma schema and updates the generated Prisma Client library inside `node_modules/@prisma/client`.

#### Use Prisma Client in your NestJS services

You're now able to send database queries with Prisma Client. If you want to learn more about building queries with Prisma Client, check out the [API documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/crud).

When setting up your NestJS application, you'll want to abstract away the Prisma Client API for database queries within a service. To get started, you can create a new `PrismaService` that takes care of instantiating `PrismaClient` and connecting to your database.

Inside the `src` directory, create a new file called `prisma.service.ts` and add the following code to it:

```typescript
import { Injectable, OnModuleInit, OnModuleDestroy } from '@nestjs/common';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

@Injectable()
export class PrismaService extends PrismaClient
  implements OnModuleInit, OnModuleDestroy {
  async onModuleInit() {
    await this.$connect();
  }

  async onModuleDestroy() {
    await this.$disconnect();
  }
}
```

Next, you can write services that you can use to make database calls for the `User` and `Post` models from your Prisma schema.

Still inside the `src` directory, create a new file called `user.service.ts` and add the following code to it:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { PrismaService } from './prisma.service';
import {
  UserUpdateInput,
  User,
  UserCreateInput,
  UserWhereUniqueInput,
  UserWhereInput,
  UserOrderByInput,
} from '@prisma/client';

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(private prisma: PrismaService) {}

  async user(userWhereUniqueInput: UserWhereUniqueInput): Promise<User | null> {
    return this.prisma.user.findOne({
      where: userWhereUniqueInput,
    });
  }

  async users(params: {
    skip?: number;
    take?: number;
    cursor?: UserWhereUniqueInput;
    where?: UserWhereInput;
    orderBy?: UserOrderByInput;
  }): Promise<User[]> {
    const { skip, take, cursor, where, orderBy } = params;
    return this.prisma.user.findMany({
      skip,
      take,
      cursor,
      where,
      orderBy,
    });
  }

  async createUser(data: UserCreateInput): Promise<User> {
    return this.prisma.user.create({
      data,
    });
  }

  async updateUser(params: {
    where: UserWhereUniqueInput;
    data: UserUpdateInput;
  }): Promise<User> {
    const { where, data } = params;
    return this.prisma.user.update({
      data,
      where,
    });
  }

  async deleteUser(where: UserWhereUniqueInput): Promise<User> {
    return this.prisma.user.delete({
      where,
    });
  }
}
```

Notice how you're using Prisma Client's generated types to ensure that the methods that are exposed by your service are properly typed. You therefore save the boilerplate of typing your models and creating additional interface or DTO files.

Now do the same for the `Post` model.

Still inside the `src` directory, create a new file called `post.service.ts` and add the following code to it:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { PrismaService } from './prisma.service';
import {
  PostUpdateInput,
  Post,
  PostCreateInput,
  PostWhereUniqueInput,
  PostWhereInput,
  PostOrderByInput,
} from '@prisma/client';

@Injectable()
export class PostService {
  constructor(private prisma: PrismaService) {}

  async post(postWhereUniqueInput: PostWhereUniqueInput): Promise<Post | null> {
    return this.prisma.post.findOne({
      where: postWhereUniqueInput,
    });
  }

  async posts(params: {
    skip?: number;
    take?: number;
    cursor?: PostWhereUniqueInput;
    where?: PostWhereInput;
    orderBy?: PostOrderByInput;
  }): Promise<Post[]> {
    const { skip, take, cursor, where, orderBy } = params;
    return this.prisma.post.findMany({
      skip,
      take,
      cursor,
      where,
      orderBy,
    });
  }

  async createPost(data: PostCreateInput): Promise<Post> {
    return this.prisma.post.create({
      data,
    });
  }

  async updatePost(params: {
    where: PostWhereUniqueInput;
    data: PostUpdateInput;
  }): Promise<Post> {
    const { data, where } = params;
    return this.prisma.post.update({
      data,
      where,
    });
  }

  async deletePost(where: PostWhereUniqueInput): Promise<Post> {
    return this.prisma.post.delete({
      where,
    });
  }
}
```

Your `UserService` and `PostService` currently wrap the CRUD queries that are available in Prisma Client. In a real world application, the service would also be the place to add business logic to your application. For example, you could have a method called `updatePassword` inside the `UserService` that would be responsible for updating the password of a user.

##### Implement your REST API routes in the main app controller

Finally, you'll use the services you created in the previous sections to implement the different routes of your app. For the purpose of this guide, you'll put all your routes into the already existing `AppController` class.

Replace the contents of the `app.controller.ts` file with the following code:

```typescript
import {
  Controller,
  Get,
  Param,
  Post,
  Body,
  Put,
  Delete,
} from '@nestjs/common';
import { UserService } from './user.service';
import { PostService } from './post.service';
import { User as UserModel, Post as PostModel } from '@prisma/client';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(
    private readonly userService: UserService,
    private readonly postService: PostService,
  ) {}

  @Get('post/:id')
  async getPostById(@Param('id') id: string): Promise<PostModel> {
    return this.postService.post({ id: Number(id) });
  }

  @Get('feed')
  async getPublishedPosts(): Promise<PostModel[]> {
    return this.postService.posts({
      where: { published: true },
    });
  }

  @Get('filtered-posts/:searchString')
  async getFilteredPosts(
    @Param('searchString') searchString: string,
  ): Promise<PostModel[]> {
    return this.postService.posts({
      where: {
        OR: [
          {
            title: { contains: searchString },
          },
          {
            content: { contains: searchString },
          },
        ],
      },
    });
  }

  @Post('post')
  async createDraft(
    @Body() postData: { title: string; content?: string; authorEmail: string },
  ): Promise<PostModel> {
    const { title, content, authorEmail } = postData;
    return this.postService.createPost({
      title,
      content,
      User: {
        connect: { email: authorEmail },
      },
    });
  }

  @Post('user')
  async signupUser(
    @Body() userData: { name?: string; email: string },
  ): Promise<UserModel> {
    return this.userService.createUser(userData);
  }

  @Put('publish/:id')
  async publishPost(@Param('id') id: string): Promise<PostModel> {
    return this.postService.updatePost({
      where: { id: Number(id) },
      data: { published: true },
    });
  }

  @Delete('post/:id')
  async deletePost(@Param('id') id: string): Promise<PostModel> {
    return this.postService.deletePost({ id: Number(id) });
  }
}
```

This controller implements the following routes:

###### `GET`

- `/post/:id`: Fetch a single post by its `id`
- `/feed`: Fetch all _published_ posts
- `/filter-posts/:searchString`: Filter posts by `title` or `content`

###### `POST`

- `/post`: Create a new post
  - Body:
    - `title: String` (required): The title of the post
    - `content: String` (optional): The content of the post
    - `authorEmail: String` (required): The email of the user that creates the post
- `/user`: Create a new user
  - Body:
    - `email: String` (required): The email address of the user
    - `name: String` (optional): The name of the user

###### `PUT`

- `/publish/:id`: Publish a post by its `id`

###### `DELETE`

- `/post/:id`: Delete a post by its `id`

#### Summary

In this recipe, you learned how to use Prisma along with NestJS to implement a REST API. The controller that implements the routes of the API is calling a `PrismaService` which in turn uses Prisma Client to send queries to a database to fulfill the data needs of incoming requests.

### Healthchecks (Terminus) <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/terminus"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="terminus" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

The NestJS **Terminus** integration supports you with **readiness / liveness** health checks. Healthchecks are very important when it comes to complex
backend setups. In a nutshell, a health check in the realm of web development usually consists of a special address, for example, `https://my-website.com/health/readiness`.
A service, or a component of your infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes) checks this address continuously. Depending on the HTTP status code returned from a `GET` request to this address the service will take action when it receives an "unhealthy" response.
Since the definition of "healthy" or "unhealthy" varies with the type of service you provide, the NestJS **Terminus** integration supports you with a
set of **health indicators**.

As an example, if your web server uses MongoDB to store its data, it would be crucial information whether MongoDB is still up and running.
In that case, you can make use of the `MongooseHealthIndicator`. If configured correctly - more on that later - your health check address will return
a healthy or unhealthy HTTP status code, depending on whether MongoDB is running.

#### Getting started

To get started with `@nestjs/terminus` we need to install the required dependency.

```bash
$ npm install --save @nestjs/terminus
```

#### Setting up a Healthcheck

A health check represents a summary of **health indicators**. A health indicator executes a check of a service, whether it is in a healthy or unhealthy state. A health check is positive if all the assigned health indicators are up and running. Because a lot of applications will need similar health indicators, [@nestjs/terminus](https://github.com/nestjs/terminus) provides a set of predefined indicators, such as:

- `DNSHealthIndicator`
- `TypeOrmHealthIndicator`
- `MongooseHealthIndicator`
- `MicroserviceHealthIndicator`
- `GRPCHealthIndicator`
- `MemoryHealthIndicator`
- `DiskHealthIndicator`


To get started with our first health check, we need to import the `TerminusModule` into our `AppModule`.

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TerminusModule } from '@nestjs/terminus';

@Module({
  imports: [TerminusModule]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Our healthcheck(s) can be executed using a [controller](/controllers), which can be easily setup using the [NestJS CLI](cli/overview).

```bash
$ nest generate controller health
```

> info **Info** It is highly recommended to enable shutdown hooks in your application. The Terminus integration makes use of this lifecycle event if enabled. Read more about shutdown hooks [here](fundamentals/lifecycle-events#application-shutdown).

#### DNS Healthcheck

Once we have installed `@nestjs/terminus`, imported our `TerminusModule` and created a new controller, we are ready to create a health check.

```typescript
@@filename(health.controller)
@Controller('health')
export class HealthController {
  constructor(
    private health: HealthCheckService,
    private dns: DNSHealthIndicator,
  ) {}

  @Get()
  @HealthCheck()
  check() {
    return this.health.check([
      () => this.dns.pingCheck('nestjs-docs', 'https://docs.nestjs.com'),
    ]);
  }
}
@@switch
@Controller('health')
@Dependencies(HealthCheckService, DNSHealthIndicator)
export class HealthController {
  constructor(
    private health,
    private dns,
  ) { }

  @Get()
  @HealthCheck()
  healthCheck() {
    return this.health.check([
      async () => this.dns.pingCheck('nestjs-docs', 'https://docs.nestjs.com'),
    ])
  }
}
```

Our health check will now send a *GET*-request to the `https://docs.nestjs.com` address. If
we get a healthy response from that address, our route at `http://localhost:3000/health` will return
the following object with a 200 status code.

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "info": {
    "nestjs-docs": {
      "status": "up"
    }
  },
  "error": {},
  "details": {
    "nestjs-docs": {
      "status": "up"
    }
  }
}
```

The interface of this response object can be accessed from the `@nestjs/terminus` package with the `HealthCheckResult` interface.

|           |                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                      |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `status`  | If any health indicator failed the status will be `'error'`. If the NestJS app is shutting down but still accepting HTTP requests, the health check will have the `'shutting_down'` status. | `'error' \| 'ok' \| 'shutting_down'` |
| `info`    | Object containing information of each health indicator which is of status `'up'`, or in other words "healthy".                                                                              | `object`                             |
| `error`   | Object containing information of each health indicator which is of status `'down'`, or in other words "unhealthy".                                                                          | `object`                             |
| `details` | Object containing all information of each health indicator                                                                                                                                  | `object`                             |

#### Custom health indicator

In some cases, the predefined health indicators provided by `@nestjs/terminus` do not cover all of your health check requirements. In that case, you can set up a custom health indicator according to your needs.

Let's get started by creating a service that will represent our custom indicator. To get a basic understanding of how an indicator is structured, we will create an example `DogHealthIndicator`. This service should have the state `'up'` if every `Dog` object has the type `'goodboy'`. If that condition is not satisfied then it should throw an error.

```typescript
@@filename(dog.health)
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { HealthIndicator, HealthIndicatorResult, HealthCheckError } from '@nestjs/terminus';

export interface Dog {
  name: string;
  type: string;
}

@Injectable()
export class DogHealthIndicator extends HealthIndicator {
  private dogs: Dog[] = [
    { name: 'Fido', type: 'goodboy' },
    { name: 'Rex', type: 'badboy' },
  ];

  async isHealthy(key: string): Promise<HealthIndicatorResult> {
    const badboys = this.dogs.filter(dog => dog.type === 'badboy');
    const isHealthy = badboys.length === 0;
    const result = this.getStatus(key, isHealthy, { badboys: badboys.length });

    if (isHealthy) {
      return result;
    }
    throw new HealthCheckError('Dogcheck failed', result);
  }
}
@@switch
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { HealthCheckError } from '@godaddy/terminus';

@Injectable()
export class DogHealthIndicator extends HealthIndicator {
  dogs = [
    { name: 'Fido', type: 'goodboy' },
    { name: 'Rex', type: 'badboy' },
  ];

  async isHealthy(key) {
    const badboys = this.dogs.filter(dog => dog.type === 'badboy');
    const isHealthy = badboys.length === 0;
    const result = this.getStatus(key, isHealthy, { badboys: badboys.length });

    if (isHealthy) {
      return result;
    }
    throw new HealthCheckError('Dogcheck failed', result);
  }
}
```

The next thing we need to do is register the health indicator as a provider.

```typescript
@@filename(app.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TerminusModule } from '@nestjs/terminus';
import { DogHealthIndicator } from './dog.health';

@Module({
  controllers: [HealthController],
  imports: [TerminusModule],
  providers: [DogHealthIndicator]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

> info **Hint** In a real-world application the `DogHealthIndicator` should be provided in a separate module, for example, `DogModule`, which then will be imported by the `AppModule`.

The last required step is to add the now available health indicator in the required health check endpoint. For that, we go back to our `HealthController` and add it to our `check` function.

```typescript
@@filename(health.controller)
import { HealthCheckService } from '@nestjs/terminus';
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { DogHealthIndicator } from './dog.health';

@Injectable()
export class HealthController {
  constructor(
    private health: HealthCheckService,
    private dogHealthIndicator: DogHealthIndicator
  ) {}

  @Get()
  @HealthCheck()
  healthCheck() {
    return this.health.check([
      async () => this.dogHealthIndicator.isHealthy('dog'),
    ])
  }
}
@@switch
import { HealthCheckService } from '@nestjs/terminus';
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { DogHealthIndicator } from './dog.health';

@Injectable()
@Dependencies(HealthCheckService, DogHealthIndicator)
export class HealthController {
  constructor(
    private health,
    private dogHealthIndicator
  ) {}

  @Get()
  @HealthCheck()
  healthCheck() {
    return this.health.check([
      async () => this.dogHealthIndicator.isHealthy('dog'),
    ])
  }
}
```
### Documentation <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/documentation"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="documentation" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

**Compodoc** is a documentation tool for Angular applications. Since Nest and Angular share similar project and code structures, **Compodoc** works with Nest applications as well.

#### Setup

Setting up Compodoc inside an existing Nest project is very simple. Start by adding the dev-dependency with the following command in your OS terminal:

```bash
$ npm i -D @compodoc/compodoc
```

#### Generation

Generate project documentation using the following command (npm 6 is required for `npx` support). See [the official documentation](https://compodoc.app/guides/usage.html) for more options.

```bash
$ npx @compodoc/compodoc -p tsconfig.json -s
```

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see an initial Nest CLI project:

<figure><img src="https://github.com/Luxcium/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/src/assets/documentation-compodoc-2.jpg" /></figure>

#### Contribute

You can participate and contribute to the Compodoc project [here](https://github.com/compodoc/compodoc).
### Hot Reload <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/hot-reload"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="hot-reload" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

The highest impact on your application's bootstrapping process is **TypeScript compilation**. Fortunately, with [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) HMR (Hot-Module Replacement), we don't need to recompile the entire project each time a change occurs. This significantly decreases the amount of time necessary to instantiate your application, and makes iterative development a lot easier.

> warning **Warning** Note that `webpack` won't automatically copy your assets (e.g. `graphql` files) to the `dist` folder. Similarly, `webpack` is not compatible with glob static paths (e.g., the `entities` property in `TypeOrmModule`).

#### With CLI

If you are using the [Nest CLI](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview), the configuration process is pretty straightforward. The CLI wraps `webpack`, which allows use of the `HotModuleReplacementPlugin`.

##### Installation

First install the required packages:

```bash
$ npm i --save-dev webpack-node-externals start-server-webpack-plugin
```

##### Configuration

Once the installation is complete, create a `webpack-hmr.config.js` file in the root directory of your application.

```typescript
const webpack = require('webpack');
const nodeExternals = require('webpack-node-externals');
const StartServerPlugin = require('start-server-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = function(options) {
  return {
    ...options,
    entry: ['webpack/hot/poll?100', options.entry],
    watch: true,
    externals: [
      nodeExternals({
        allowlist: ['webpack/hot/poll?100'],
      }),
    ],
    plugins: [
      ...options.plugins,
      new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),
      new webpack.WatchIgnorePlugin([/\.js$/, /\.d\.ts$/]),
      new StartServerPlugin({ name: options.output.filename }),
    ],
  };
};
```

This function takes the original object containing the default webpack configuration and returns a modified one with an applied `HotModuleReplacementPlugin` plugin.

##### Hot-Module Replacement

To enable **HMR**, open the application entry file (`main.ts`) and add the following webpack-related instructions:

```typescript
declare const module: any;

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  await app.listen(3000);

  if (module.hot) {
    module.hot.accept();
    module.hot.dispose(() => app.close());
  }
}
bootstrap();
```

To simplify the execution process, add a script to your `package.json` file.

```json
"start:dev": "nest build --webpack --webpackPath webpack-hmr.config.js"
```

Now simply open your command line and run the following command:

```bash
$ npm run start:dev
```

#### Without CLI

If you are not using the [Nest CLI](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview), the configuration will be slightly more complex (will require more manual steps).

##### Installation

First install the required packages:

```bash
$ npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-node-externals ts-loader start-server-webpack-plugin
```

##### Configuration

Once the installation is complete, create a `webpack.config.js` file in the root directory of your application.

```typescript
const webpack = require('webpack');
const path = require('path');
const nodeExternals = require('webpack-node-externals');
const StartServerPlugin = require('start-server-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: ['webpack/hot/poll?100', './src/main.ts'],
  watch: true,
  target: 'node',
  externals: [
    nodeExternals({
      allowlist: ['webpack/hot/poll?100'],
    }),
  ],
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /.tsx?$/,
        use: 'ts-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
    ],
  },
  mode: 'development',
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.tsx', '.ts', '.js'],
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),
    new StartServerPlugin({ name: 'server.js' }),
  ],
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'server.js',
  },
};
```

This configuration tells webpack a few essential things about your application: location of the entry file, which directory should be used to hold **compiled** files, and what kind of loader we want to use to compile source files. Generally, you should be able to use this file as-is, even if you don't fully understand all of the options.

##### Hot-Module Replacement

To enable **HMR**, open the application entry file (`main.ts`) and add the following webpack-related instructions:

```typescript
declare const module: any;

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  await app.listen(3000);

  if (module.hot) {
    module.hot.accept();
    module.hot.dispose(() => app.close());
  }
}
bootstrap();
```

To simplify the execution process, add a script to your `package.json` file.

```json
"start:dev": "webpack --config webpack.config.js"
```

Now simply open your command line and run the following command:

```bash
$ npm run start:dev
```

A working example is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/08-webpack).


### Serve Static <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/serve-static"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="serve-static" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

In order to serve static content like a Single Page Application (SPA) we can use the `ServeStaticModule` from the [`@nestjs/serve-static`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nestjs/serve-static) package.

#### Installation

First we need to install the required package:

```bash
$ npm install --save @nestjs/serve-static
```

#### Bootstrap

Once the installation process is done, we can import the `ServeStaticModule` into the root `AppModule` and configure it by passing in a configuration object to the `forRoot()` method.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { ServeStaticModule } from '@nestjs/serve-static';
import { join } from 'path';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ServeStaticModule.forRoot({
      rootPath: join(__dirname, '..', 'client'),
    }),
  ],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

With this in place, build the static website and place its content in the location specified by the `rootPath` property.

#### Summary

A working example is available [here](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/tree/master/sample/24-serve-static).

#### CRUD utilities

> warning **Notice** This chapter applies only to TypeScript.

##### Overview

[CRUD](https://github.com/nestjsx/crud) is a **community package** (`@nestjsx/crud`) that helps you create database-centric Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) controllers and services with ease, and provides a rich set of features for your RESTful API out-of-the-box:

- Database agnostic extendable CRUD controller
- Query string parsing with filtering, pagination, sorting, relations, nested relations, cache, etc.
- Framework agnostic package with query builder for frontend usage
- Query, path params and DTO validation
- Overriding controller methods with ease
- Tiny but powerful configuration (including global configuration)
- Additional helper decorators
- Swagger documentation

> warning **Notice** Currently `@nestjsx/crud` only supports `TypeORM`. Other ORMs like `Sequelize` and `Mongoose` will be included in the near future.

In this chapter, you'll get an overview of how to create CRUD controllers and services using `TypeORM`. Complete documentation is available at the project's [wiki](https://github.com/nestjsx/crud/wiki/Home). We assume that you have already successfully installed and set up the `@nestjs/typeorm` package. To learn more, see [here](/techniques/sql).

##### Getting started

Start by installing all required dependencies:

```bash
npm i --save @nestjsx/crud @nestjsx/crud-typeorm typeorm class-transformer class-validator
```

Assuming that you already have some **entities** in your project:

```typescript
@@filename(hero.entity)
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
export class Hero {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  name: string;

  @Column({ type: 'number' })
  power: number;
}
```

The first step is to create a **service**:

```typescript
@@filename(heroes.service)
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectRepository } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
import { TypeOrmCrudService } from '@nestjsx/crud-typeorm';
import { Hero } from './hero.entity';

@Injectable()
export class HeroesService extends TypeOrmCrudService<Hero> {
  constructor(@InjectRepository(Hero) repo) {
    super(repo);
  }
}
```

The next step is to create a **controller**:

```typescript
@@filename(heroes.controller)
import { Controller } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Crud } from '@nestjsx/crud';
import { Hero } from './hero.entity';
import { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';

@Crud({
  model: {
    type: Hero,
  },
})
@Controller('heroes')
export class HeroesController {
  constructor(public service: HeroesService) {}
}
```

And finally, we need to wire up everything in our **module**:

```typescript
@@filename(heroes.module)
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { TypeOrmModule } from '@nestjs/typeorm';

import { Hero } from './hero.entity';
import { HeroesService } from './heroes.service';
import { HeroesController } from './heroes.controller';

@Module({
  imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([Hero])],
  providers: [HeroesService],
  controllers: [HeroesController],
})
export class HeroesModule {}
```

> warning **Notice** Do not forget to import the `HeroesModule` into the root `ApplicationModule`.

At this point, your application will have these newly created endpoints:

- `GET /heroes` - get many heroes.
- `GET /heroes/:id` - get one hero.
- `POST /heroes/bulk` - create many heroes.
- `POST /heroes` - create one hero.
- `PATCH /heroes/:id` - update one hero.
- `PUT /heroes/:id` - replace one hero.
- `DELETE /heroes/:id` - delete one hero.

##### Filtering and pagination

[CRUD](https://github.com/nestjsx/crud) provides rich tools for filtering and pagination. Here's a sample HTTP REST request:

```bash
GET /heroes?select=name&filter=power||gt||90&sort=name,ASC&page=1&limit=3
```

In this example, we:

- requested the list of heroes and selected only the `name` attribute
- filtered the list to include heroes with a `power` greater than 90
- limited the result set to 3 within page 1
- sorted by `name` in `ASC` order

The response object would look like this:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Batman"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "name": "Flash"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Superman"
    }
  ],
  "count": 3,
  "total": 14,
  "page": 1,
  "pageCount": 5
}
```

> warning **Notice** Primary columns persist in the resource response object whether they were requested or not. In our example, this is the `id` column.

The complete list of query params and filter operators can be found in the project's [Wiki](https://github.com/nestjsx/crud/wiki/Requests).

##### Relations

**Relations** is another powerful feature. In your CRUD controller, you can specify the list of an entity's relations which are allowed to fetch within your API calls:

```typescript
@Crud({
  model: {
    type: Hero,
  },
  join: {
    profile: {
      exclude: ['secret'],
    },
    faction: {
      eager: true,
      only: ['name'],
    },
  },
})
@Controller('heroes')
export class HeroesController {
  constructor(public service: HeroesService) {}
}
```

After specifying allowed relations in the `@Crud()` decorator options, you can make the following request:

> info **Request** GET /heroes/25?**join**=profile||address,bio

The response will contain a hero object with a joined profile which includes the `address` and `bio` columns.

The response will also contain a `faction` object with the `name` column selected because it was set to `eager: true` (and thus persists in every response).

You can find more information about relations in the project's [WiKi](https://github.com/nestjsx/crud/wiki/Controllers#join).

##### Path params validation

By default, [CRUD](https://github.com/nestjsx/crud) creates a slug with the name `id` and validates it as a `number`. You can modify this behavior if desired. Assume, your entity has a primary column `_id` - a UUID string - and you need to use it as a slug for your endpoints. This can be done with the following options:

```typescript
@Crud({
  model: {
    type: Hero,
  },
  params: {
    _id: {
      field: '_id',
      type: 'uuid',
      primary: true,
    },
  },
})
@Controller('heroes')
export class HeroesController {
  constructor(public service: HeroesService) {}
}
```

For more params options please see the project's [Wiki](https://github.com/nestjsx/crud/wiki/Controllers#params).

##### Request body validation

Request body validation is performed out-of-the-box by applying the standard Nest `ValidationPipe` on each POST, PUT or PATCH request. The `model.type` from the `@Crud()` decorator options is used as a DTO that describes validation rules.

To do that properly we use [validation groups](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator#validation-groups):

```typescript
@@filename(hero.entity)
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from 'typeorm';
import { IsOptional, IsDefined, IsString, IsNumber } from 'class-validator';
import { CrudValidationGroups } from '@nestjsx/crud';

const { CREATE, UPDATE } = CrudValidationGroups;

@Entity()
export class Hero {
  @IsOptional({ always: true })
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @IsOptional({ groups: [UPDATE] })
  @IsDefined({ groups: [CREATE] })
  @IsString({ always: true })
  @Column()
  name: string;

  @IsOptional({ groups: [UPDATE] })
  @IsDefined({ groups: [CREATE] })
  @IsNumber({}, { always: true })
  @Column({ type: 'number' })
  power: number;
}
```

> warning **Notice** Full support of separate DTO classes for `create` and `update` actions is one of the main priorities for the next [CRUD](https://github.com/nestjsx/crud) release.

##### Routes options

You can disable or enable generation of specific routes by passing the `routes` options property to the `@Crud()` decorator:

```typescript
@Crud({
  model: {
    type: Hero,
  },
  routes: {
    only: ['getManyBase'],
    getManyBase: {
      decorators: [UseGuards(HeroAuthGuard)],
    },
  },
})
@Controller('heroes')
export class HeroesController {
  constructor(public service: HeroesService) {}
}
```

You can apply any method decorators by passing them to the specific route `decorators` array. This is convenient when you want to add some decorators without overriding base methods.

##### Documentation

The examples in this chapter cover only some of the [CRUD](https://github.com/nestjsx/crud) features. You can find complete documentation on the project's [Wiki](https://github.com/nestjsx/crud/wiki/Home) page.

### HTTP adapter <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/faq/http-adapter"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="http-adapter" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Occasionally, you may want to access the underlying HTTP server, either within the Nest application context or from the outside.

Every native (platform-specific) HTTP server/library (e.g., Express and Fastify) instance is wrapped in an **adapter**. The adapter is registered as a globally available provider that can be retrieved from the application context, as well as injected into other providers.

#### Outside application context strategy

To get a reference to the `HttpAdapter` from outside of the application context, call the `getHttpAdapter()` method.

```typescript
@@filename()
const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule);
const httpAdapter = app.getHttpAdapter();
```

#### In-context strategy

To get a reference to the `HttpAdapterHost` from within the application context, inject it using the same technique as any other existing provider (e.g., using constructor injection).

```typescript
@@filename()
export class CatsService {
  constructor(private adapterHost: HttpAdapterHost) {}
}
@@switch
@Dependencies(HttpAdapterHost)
export class CatsService {
  constructor(adapterHost) {
    this.adapterHost = adapterHost;
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** The `HttpAdapterHost` is imported from the `@nestjs/core` package.

The `HttpAdapterHost` is **not** an actual `HttpAdapter`. To get the actual `HttpAdapter` instance, simply access the `httpAdapter` property.

```typescript
const adapterHost = app.get(HttpAdapterHost);
const httpAdapter = adapterHost.httpAdapter;
```

The `httpAdapter` is the actual instance of the HTTP adapter used by the underlying framework. It is an instance of either `ExpressAdapter` or `FastifyAdapter` (both classes extend `AbstractHttpAdapter`).

The adapter object exposes several useful methods to interact with the HTTP server. However, if you want to access the library instance (e.g., the Express instance) directly, call the `getInstance()` method.

```typescript
const instance = httpAdapter.getInstance();
```


### Global prefix <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/faq/global-prefix"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="global-prefix" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

To set a prefix for **every route** registered in an HTTP application, use the `setGlobalPrefix()` method of the `INestApplication` instance.

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
app.setGlobalPrefix('v1');
```


### Hybrid application <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/faq/hybrid-application"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="hybrid-application" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

A hybrid application is one that both listens for HTTP requests, as well as makes use of connected microservices. The `INestApplication` instance can be connected with `INestMicroservice` instances through the `connectMicroservice()` method.

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
const microservice = app.connectMicroservice({
  transport: Transport.TCP,
});

await app.startAllMicroservicesAsync();
await app.listen(3001);
```

To connect multiple microservice instances, issue the call to `connectMicroservice()` for each microservice:

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
// microservice #1
const microserviceTcp = app.connectMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>({
  transport: Transport.TCP,
  options: {
    port: 3001,
  },
});
// microservice #2
const microserviceRedis = app.connectMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>({
  transport: Transport.REDIS,
  options: {
    url: 'redis://localhost:6379',
  },
});

await app.startAllMicroservicesAsync();
await app.listen(3001);
```

#### Sharing configuration


By default a hybrid application will not inherit global pipes, interceptors, guards and filters configured for the main (HTTP-based) application.
To inherit these configuration properties from the main application, set the `inheritAppConfig` property in the second argument (an optional options object) of the `connectMicroservice()` call, as follow:

```typescript
const microservice = app.connectMicroservice({
  transport: Transport.TCP
}, { inheritAppConfig: true });
```


### HTTPS <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/faq/multiple-servers"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="multiple-servers" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

To create an application that uses the HTTPS protocol, set the `httpsOptions` property in the options object passed to the `create()` method of the `NestFactory` class:

```typescript
const httpsOptions = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('./secrets/private-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('./secrets/public-certificate.pem'),
};
const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule, {
  httpsOptions,
});
await app.listen(3000);
```

If you use the `FastifyAdapter`, create the application as follows:

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create<NestFastifyApplication>(
  ApplicationModule,
  new FastifyAdapter({ https: httpsOptions }),
);
```

#### Multiple simultaneous servers

The following recipe shows how to instantiate a Nest application that listens on multiple ports (for example, on a non-HTTPS port and an HTTPS port) simultaneously.

```typescript
const httpsOptions = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('./secrets/private-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('./secrets/public-certificate.pem'),
};

const server = express();
const app = await NestFactory.create(
  ApplicationModule,
  new ExpressAdapter(server),
);
await app.init();

http.createServer(server).listen(3000);
https.createServer(httpsOptions, server).listen(443);
```

> info **Hint** The `ExpressAdapter` is imported from the `@nestjs/platform-express` package. The `http` and `https` packages are native Node.js packages.

> **Warning** This recipe does not work with [GraphQL Subscriptions](/graphql/subscriptions).


### Request lifecycle  <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/faq/request-lifecycle"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="request-lifecycle" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

Nest applications handle requests and produce responses in a sequence we refer to as the **request lifecycle**. With the use of middleware, pipes, guards, and interceptors, it can be challenging to track down where a particular piece of code executes during the request lifecycle, especially as global, controller level, and route level components come into play. In general, a request flows through middleware to guards, then to interceptors, then to pipes and finally back to interceptors on the return path (as the response is generated).

#### Middleware

Middleware is executed in a particular sequence. First, Nest runs globally bound middleware (such as middleware bound with `app.use`) and then it runs [module bound middleware](/middleware), which are determined on paths. Middleware are run sequentially in the order they are bound, similar to the way middleware in Express works. In the case of middleware bound across different modules, the middleware bound to the root module will run first, and then middleware will run in the order that the modules are added to the imports array.

#### Guards

Guard execution starts with global guards, then proceeds to controller guards, and finally to route guards. As with middleware, guards run in the order in which they are bound. For example:

```typescript
@UseGuards(Guard1, Guard2)
@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  constructor(private catsService: CatsService) {}

  @UseGuards(Guard3)
  @Get()
  getCats(): Cats[] {
    return this.catsService.getCats();
  }
}
```

`Guard1` will execute before `Guard2` and both will execute before `Guard3`.

> info **Hint** When speaking about globally bound vs controller or locally bound, the difference is where the guard (or other component is bound). If you are using `app.useGlobalGuard()` or providing the component via a module, it is globally bound. Otherwise, it is bound to a controller if the decorator precedes a controller class, or to a route if the decorator proceeds a route declaration.

#### Interceptors

Interceptors, for the most part, follow the same pattern as guards, with one catch: as interceptors return [RxJS Observables](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs), the observables will be resolved in a first in last out manner. So inbound requests will go through the standard global, controller, route level resolution, but the response side of the request (i.e., after returning from the controller method handler) will be resolved from route to controller to global. Also, any errors thrown by pipes, controllers, or services can be read in the `catchError` operator of an interceptor.

#### Pipes

Pipes follow the standard global to controller to route bound sequence, with the same first in first out in regards to the `@usePipes()` parameters. However, at a route parameter level, if you have multiple pipes running, they will run in the order of the last parameter with a pipe to the first. This also applies to the route level and controller level pipes. For example, if we have the following controller:

```typescript
@UsePipes(GeneralValidationPipe)
@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  constructor(private catsService: CatsService) {}

  @UsePipes(RouteSpecificPipe)
  @Patch(':id')
  updateCat(
    @Body() body: UpdateCatDTO,
    @Param() params: UpdateCatParams,
    @Query() query: UpdateCatQuery,
  ) {
    return this.catsService.updateCat(body, params, query);
  }
}
```

then the `GeneralValidationPipe` will run for the `query`, then the `params`, and then the `body` objects before moving on to the `RouteSpecificPipe`, which follows the same order. If any parameter-specific pipes were in place, they would run (again, from the last to first parameter) after the controller and route level pipes.

#### Filters

Filters are the only component that do not resolve global first. Instead, filters resolve from the lowest level possible, meaning execution starts with any route bound filters and proceeding next to controller level, and finally to global filters. Note that exceptions cannot be passed from filter to filter; if a route level filter catches the exception, a controller or global level filter cannot catch the same exception. The only way to achieve an effect like this is to use inheritance between the filters.

> info **Hint** Filters are only executed if any uncaught exception occurs during the request process. Caught exceptions, such as those caught with a `try/catch` will not trigger Exception Filters to fire. As soon as an uncaught exception is encountered, the rest of the lifecycle is ignored and the request skips straight to the filter.

#### Summary

In general, the request lifecycle looks like the following:

1. Incoming request
1. Globally bound middleware
1. Module bound middleware
1. Global guards
1. Controller guards
1. Route guards
1. Global interceptors (pre-controller)
1. Controller interceptors (pre-controller)
1. Route interceptors (pre-controller)
1. Global pipes
1. Controller pipes
1. Route pipes
1. Route parameter pipes
1. Controller (method handler)
1. Service (if exists)
1. Route interceptor (post-request)
1. Controller interceptor (post-request)
1. Global interceptor (post-request)
1. Exception filters (route, then controller, then global)
1. Server response

### Standalone applications <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/standalone-applications"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="standalone-applications" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

There are several ways of mounting a Nest application. You can create a web app, a microservice or just a bare Nest **standalone application** (without any network listeners). The Nest standalone application is a wrapper around the Nest **IoC container**, which holds all instantiated classes. We can obtain a reference to any existing instance from within any imported module directly using the standalone application object. Thus, you can take advantage of the Nest framework anywhere, including, for example, scripted **CRON** jobs. You can even build a **CLI** on top of it.

#### Getting started

To create a Nest standalone application, use the following construction:

```typescript
@@filename()
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.createApplicationContext(ApplicationModule);
  // application logic...
}
bootstrap();
```

The standalone application object allows you to obtain a reference to any instance registered within the Nest application. Let's imagine that we have a `TasksService` in the `TasksModule`. This class provides a set of methods that we want to call from within a CRON job.

```typescript
@@filename()
const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule);
const tasksService = app.get(TasksService);
```

To access the `TasksService` instance we use the `get()` method. The `get()` method acts like a **query** that searches for an instance in each registered module. Alternatively, for strict context checking, pass an options object with the `strict: true` property. With this option in effect, you have to navigate through specific modules to obtain a particular instance from the selected context.

```typescript
@@filename()
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
const tasksService = app.select(TasksModule).get(TasksService, { strict: true });
```

Following is a summary of the methods available for retrieving instance references from the standalone application object.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>get()</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      Retrieves an instance of a controller or provider (including guards, filters, and so on) available in the application context.
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

> info **Hint** In non-strict mode, the root module is selected by default. To select any other module, you need to navigate the modules graph manually, step by step.

If you want the node application to close after the script finishes (e.g., for a script running CRON jobs), add `await app.close()` to the end of your `bootstrap` function:

```typescript
@@filename()
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.createApplicationContext(ApplicationModule);
  // application logic...
  await app.close();
}
bootstrap();
```
### Migration guide <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/migration-guide"><img src="https://nestjs.com/img/logo-small.svg" id="migration-guide" width="20" alt="Nest Logo" /></a>

This article provides a set of guidelines for migrating from Nest version 6 to version 7.

#### Custom route decorators

The [Custom decorators](/custom-decorators) API has been unified for all types of applications. Now, whether you're creating a GraphQL application or a REST API, the factory passed into the `createParamDecorator()` function will take the `ExecutionContext` (read more [here](/fundamentals/execution-context)) object as a second argument.

```typescript
@@filename()
// Before
import { createParamDecorator } from '@nestjs/common';

export const User = createParamDecorator((data, req) => {
  return req.user;
});

// After
import { createParamDecorator, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';

export const User = createParamDecorator(
  (data: unknown, ctx: ExecutionContext) => {
    const request = ctx.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    return request.user;
  },
);
@@switch
// Before
import { createParamDecorator } from '@nestjs/common';

export const User = createParamDecorator((data, req) => {
  return req.user;
});

// After
import { createParamDecorator } from '@nestjs/common';

export const User = createParamDecorator((data, ctx) => {
  const request = ctx.switchToHttp().getRequest();
  return request.user;
});
```

#### Microservices

To avoid code duplication, the `MicroserviceOptions` interface has been removed from the `@nestjs/common` package. Therefore, now when you're creating a microservice (through either `createMicroservice()` or `connectMicroservice()` method), you should pass the type generic parameter to get code autocompletion.

```typescript
@@filename()
// Before
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice(AppModule);

// After
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>(AppModule);
@@switch
// Before
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice(AppModule);

// After
const app = await NestFactory.createMicroservice(AppModule);
```

> info **Hint** The `MicroserviceOptions` interface is exported from the `@nestjs/microservices` package.

#### GraphQL

In the version 6 major release of NestJS, we introduced the code-first approach as a compatibility layer between the `type-graphql` package and the `@nestjs/graphql` module. Eventually, our team decided to reimplement all the features from scratch due to a lack of flexibility. To avoid numerous breaking changes, the public API is backward-compatible and may resemble `type-graphql`.

In order to migrate your existing application, simply rename all the `type-graphql` imports to the `@nestjs/graphql`. If you used more advanced features, you might need to also:

- use `Type` (imported from `@nestjs/common`) instead of `ClassType` (imported from `type-graphql`)
- move methods that require `@Args()` from object types (classes annotated with `@ObjectType()` decorator) under resolver classes (and use `@ResolveField()` decorator instead of `@Field()`)

#### Terminus

In the version 7 major release of `@nestjs/terminus`, a new simplified API has been introduced
to run health checks. The previously required peer dependency `@godaddy/terminus` has been removed, which allows us to integrate our health checks automatically into Swagger! Read more about the removal of `@godaddy/terminus` [here](https://github.com/nestjs/terminus/issues/340).

For most users, the biggest change will be the removal of the `TerminusModule.forRootAsync` function. With the next major version, this function will be completely removed.
To migrate to the new API, you will need to create a new controller, which will handle your health checks.

```typescript
@@filename()
// Before
@Injectable()
export class TerminusOptionsService implements TerminusOptionsFactory {
  constructor(
    private dns: DNSHealthIndicator,
  ) {}

  createTerminusOptions(): TerminusModuleOptions {
    const healthEndpoint: TerminusEndpoint = {
      url: '/health',
      healthIndicators: [
        async () => this.dns.pingCheck('google', 'https://google.com'),
      ],
    };
    return {
      endpoints: [healthEndpoint],
    };
  }
}

@Module({
  imports: [
    TerminusModule.forRootAsync({
      useClass: TerminusOptionsService
    })
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }

// After
@Controller('health')
export class HealthController {
  constructor(
    private health: HealthCheckService,
    private dns: DNSHealthIndicator,
  ) { }

  @Get()
  @HealthCheck()
  healthCheck() {
    return this.health.check([
      async () => this.dns.pingCheck('google', 'https://google.com'),
    ]);
  }
}

@Module({
  imports: [
    TerminusModule
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }

@@switch

// Before
@Injectable()
@Dependencies(DNSHealthIndicator)
export class TerminusOptionsService {
  constructor(
    private dns,
  ) {}

  createTerminusOptions() {
    const healthEndpoint = {
      url: '/health',
      healthIndicators: [
        async () => this.dns.pingCheck('google', 'https://google.com'),
      ],
    };
    return {
      endpoints: [healthEndpoint],
    };
  }
}

@Module({
  imports: [
    TerminusModule.forRootAsync({
      useClass: TerminusOptionsService
    })
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }

// After
@Controller('/health')
@Dependencies(HealthCheckService, DNSHealthIndicator)
export class HealthController {
  constructor(
    private health,
    private dns,
  ) { }

  @Get('/')
  @HealthCheck()
  healthCheck() {
    return this.health.check([
      async () => this.dns.pingCheck('google', 'https://google.com'),
    ])
  }
}

@Module({
  controllers: [
    HealthController
  ],
  imports: [
    TerminusModule
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

> warning **Warning** If you have set a [Global Prefix](faq#global-prefix) in your Nest application and you have not used the `useGlobalPrefix` Terminus option, the URL of your health check will change. Make sure to update the reference to that URL, or use the legacy Terminus API until [nestjs/nest#963](https://github.com/nestjs/nest/issues/963) is fixed.

If you are forced to use the legacy API, you can also disable deprecation messages for the time being.

```typescript
TerminusModule.forRootAsync({
  useFactory: () => ({
    disableDeprecationWarnings: true,
    endpoints: [
      // ...
    ]
  })
}
```

You should enable shutdown hooks in your `main.ts` file. The Terminus integration will listen on POSIX signals such as SIGTERM (see the [Application shutdown chapter](fundamentals/lifecycle-events#application-shutdown) for more information). When enabled, the health check route(s) will automatically respond with a Service Unavailable (503) HTTP error response when the server is shutting down.

With the removal of `@godaddy/terminus`, you will need to update your `import` statements
to use `@nestjs/terminus` instead. Most notable is the import of the `HealthCheckError`.

```typescript
@@filename(custom.health)
// Before
import { HealthCheckError } from '@godaddy/terminus';
// After
import { HealthCheckError } from '@nestjs/terminus';
```

Once you have fully migrated, make sure you uninstall `@godaddy/terminus`.

```bash
npm uninstall --save @godaddy/terminus
```

#### HTTP exceptions body

Previously, the generated response bodies for the `HttpException` class and other exceptions derived from it (e.g., `BadRequestException` or `NotFoundException`) were inconsistent. In the latest major release, these exception responses will follow the same structure.

```typescript
/*
 * Sample outputs for "throw new ForbiddenException('Forbidden resource')"
 */

// Before
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "message": "Forbidden resource"
}

// After
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "message": "Forbidden resource",
  "error": "Forbidden"
}
```

#### Validation errors schema

In past releases, the `ValidationPipe` threw an array of the `ValidationError` objects returned by the `class-validator` package. Now, `ValidationPipe` will map errors to a list of plain strings representing error messages.

```typescript
// Before
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": [
    {
      "target": {},
      "property": "email",
      "children": [],
      "constraints": {
        "isEmail": "email must be an email"
      }
    }
  ]
}

// After
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": ["email must be an email"],
  "error": "Bad Request"
}
```

If you prefer the previous approach, you can restore it by setting the `exceptionFactory` function:

```typescript
new ValidationPipe({
  exceptionFactory: (errors) => new BadRequestException(errors),
});
```

#### Implicit type conversion (`ValidationPipe`)

With the auto-transformation option enabled (`transform: true`), the `ValidationPipe` will now perform conversion of primitive types. In the following example, the `findOne()` method takes one argument which represents an extracted `id` path parameter:

```typescript
@Get(':id')
findOne(@Param('id') id: number) {
  console.log(typeof id === 'number'); // true
  return 'This action returns a user';
}
```

By default, every path parameter and query parameter comes over the network as a `string`. In the above example, we specified the `id` type as a `number` (in the method signature). Therefore, the `ValidationPipe` will try to automatically convert a string identifier to a number.

#### Microservice channels (bidirectional communication)

To enable the request-response message type, Nest creates two logical channels - one is responsible for transferring the data while the other waits for incoming responses. For some underlying transports, such as NATS, this dual-channel support is provided out-of-the-box. For others, Nest compensates by manually creating separate channels.

Let's say that we have a single message handler `@MessagePattern('getUsers')`. In the past, Nest built two channels from this pattern: `getUsers_ack` (for requests) and `getUsers_res` (for responses). With version 7, this naming scheme changes. Now Nest will build `getUsers` (for requests) and `getUsers.reply` (for responses) instead. Also, specifically for the MQTT transport strategy, the response channel would be `getUsers/reply` (to avoid conflicts with topic wildcards).

#### Deprecations

All deprecations (from Nest version 5 to version 6) have been finally removed (e.g., the deprecated `@ReflectMetadata` decorator).

#### Node.js

This release drops support for Node v8. We strongly recommend using the latest LTS version.
