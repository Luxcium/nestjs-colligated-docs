### Unions

Union types are very similar to interfaces, but they don't get to specify any common fields between the types (read more [here](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#union-types)). Unions are useful for returning disjoint data types from a single field.

#### Code first

To define a GraphQL union type, we must define classes that this union will be composed of. Following the [example](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/unions-interfaces/#union-type) from the Apollo documentation, we'll create two classes. First, `Book`:

```typescript
import { Field, ObjectType } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@ObjectType()
export class Book {
  @Field()
  title: string;
}
```

And then `Author`:

```typescript
import { Field, ObjectType } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@ObjectType()
export class Author {
  @Field()
  name: string;
}
```

With this in place, register the `Result` union using the `createUnionType` function exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package:

```typescript
export const ResultUnion = createUnionType({
  name: 'Result',
  types: () => [Author, Book],
});
```

Now, we can reference the `ResultUnion` in our query:

```typescript
@Query(returns => [ResultUnion])
search(): Array<typeof ResultUnion> {
  return [new Author(), new Book()];
}
```

This will result in generating the following part of the GraphQL schema in SDL:

```graphql
type Author {
  name: String!
}

type Book {
  title: String!
}

union ResultUnion = Author | Book

type Query {
  search: [ResultUnion!]!
}
```

The default `resolveType()` function generated by the library will extract the type based on the value returned from the resolver method. That means returning class instances instead of literal JavaScript object is obligatory.

To provide a customized `resolveType()` function, pass the `resolveType` property to the options object passed into the `createUnionType()` function, as follows:

```typescript
export const ResultUnion = createUnionType({
  name: 'Result',
  types: () => [Author, Book],
  resolveType(value) {
    if (value.name) {
      return Author;
    }
    if (value.title) {
      return Book;
    }
    return null;
  },
});
```

#### Schema first

To define a union in the schema first approach, simply create a GraphQL union with SDL.

```graphql
type Author {
  name: String!
}

type Book {
  title: String!
}

union ResultUnion = Author | Book
```

Then, you can use the typings generation feature (as shown in the [quick start](/graphql/quick-start) chapter) to generate corresponding TypeScript definitions:

```typescript
export class Author {
  name: string;
}

export class Book {
  title: string;
}

export type ResultUnion = Author | Book;
```

Unions require an extra `__resolveType` field in the resolver map to determine which type the union should resolve to. Let's create a `ResultUnionResolver` class and define the `__resolveType` method:

```typescript
@Resolver('ResultUnion')
export class ResultUnionResolver {
  @ResolveField()
  __resolveType(value) {
    if (value.name) {
      return 'Author';
    }
    if (value.title) {
      return 'Book';
    }
    return null;
  }
}
```

> info **Hint** All decorators are exported from the `@nestjs/graphql` package.
