### Federation

[Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/introduction/) offers a means of splitting your monolithic GraphQL server into independent microservices. It consists of two components: a gateway and one or more federated microservices. Each microservice holds part of the schema and the gateway merges the schemas into a single schema that can be consumed by the client.

To quote the [Apollo docs](https://blog.apollographql.com/apollo-federation-f260cf525d21), Federation is designed with these core principles:

- Building a graph should be **declarative.** With federation, you compose a graph declaratively from within your schema instead of writing imperative schema stitching code.
- Code should be separated by **concern**, not by types. Often no single team controls every aspect of an important type like a User or Product, so the definition of these types should be distributed across teams and codebases, rather than centralized.
- The graph should be simple for clients to consume. Together, federated services can form a complete, product-focused graph that accurately reflects how it’s being consumed on the client.
- It’s just **GraphQL**, using only spec-compliant features of the language. Any language, not just JavaScript, can implement federation.

> warning **Warning** Apollo Federation currently does not support subscriptions.

In the next example, we'll set up a demo application with a gateway and two federated endpoints: a Users service and a Posts service.

#### Federated example: Users

First install the optional dependency for federation:

```bash
$ npm install --save @apollo/federation
```

The User service has a simple schema. Note the `@key` directive: it tells the Apollo query planner that a particular instance of User can be fetched if you have its `id`. Also note that we extend the `Query` type.

```graphql
type User @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}

extend type Query {
  getUser(id: ID!): User
}
```

Our resolver has one extra method: `resolveReference`. It's called by the Apollo Gateway whenever a related resource requires a User instance. We'll see an example of this in the Posts service later on. Please note the `@ResolveReference` decorator.

```typescript
import { Args, Query, Resolver, ResolveReference } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { UsersService } from './users.service';

@Resolver('User')
export class UsersResolvers {
  constructor(private usersService: UsersService) {}

  @Query()
  getUser(@Args('id') id: string) {
    return this.usersService.findById(id);
  }

  @ResolveReference()
  resolveReference(reference: { __typename: string; id: string }) {
    return this.usersService.findById(reference.id);
  }
}
```

Finally, we hook everything up in a module together with a `GraphQLFederationModule`. This module accepts the same options as the regular `GraphQLModule`.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { GraphQLFederationModule } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { UsersResolvers } from './users.resolvers';

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLFederationModule.forRoot({
      typePaths: ['**/*.graphql'],
    }),
  ],
  providers: [UsersResolvers],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### Federated example: Posts

The Posts service references the User type in its schema by marking it with the `extend` keyword. It also adds one property to the User type. Note the `@key` directive used for matching instances of User, and the `@external` directive indicating that the `id` field is managed elsewhere.

```graphql
type Post @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  body: String!
  user: User
}

extend type User @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
  posts: [Post]
}

extend type Query {
  getPosts: [Post]
}
```

Our resolver has one method of interest here: `getUser`. It returns a reference containing `__typename` and any additional properties your application needs to resolve the reference, in this case only an `id`. The `__typename` is used by the GraphQL Gateway to pinpoint the microservice responsible for the User type and request the instance. The Users service discussed above will be called on the `resolveReference` method.

```typescript
import { Query, Resolver, Parent, ResolveProperty } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { PostsService } from './posts.service';
import { Post } from './posts.interfaces';

@Resolver('Post')
export class PostsResolvers {
  constructor(private postsService: PostsService) {}

  @Query('getPosts')
  getPosts() {
    return this.postsService.findAll();
  }

  @ResolveProperty('user')
  getUser(@Parent() post: Post) {
    return { __typename: 'User', id: post.userId };
  }
}
```

The Posts service has virtually the same module, but is included below for the sake of completeness:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { GraphQLFederationModule } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { PostsResolvers } from './posts.resolvers';

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLFederationModule.forRoot({
      typePaths: ['**/*.graphql'],
    }),
  ],
  providers: [PostsResolvers],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### Federated example: Gateway

First install the optional dependency for the gateway: `npm install --save @apollo/gateway`.

Our gateway only needs a list of endpoints and will auto-discover the schemas from there. The code for our gateway is therefore very short:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { GraphQLGatewayModule } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLGatewayModule.forRoot({
      server: {
        // ... Apollo server options
        cors: true,
      },
      gateway: {
        serviceList: [
          { name: 'users', url: 'http://user-service/graphql' },
          { name: 'posts', url: 'http://post-service/graphql' },
        ],
      },
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> info **Hint** Apollo recommends that you don't rely on the service discovery in a production environment but use their [Graph Manager](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graph-manager/federation/) instead.

#### Sharing context

You can customize the requests between the gateway and federated services using a build service. This allows you to share context about the request. You can easily extend the default `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` and implement one of the hooks. Please refer to [Apollo Docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/apollo-gateway/#remotegraphqldatasource) on `RemoteGraphQLDataSource` for more information about the possibilities.

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { GATEWAY_BUILD_SERVICE, GraphQLGatewayModule } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { RemoteGraphQLDataSource } from '@apollo/gateway';
import { decode } from 'jsonwebtoken';

class AuthenticatedDataSource extends RemoteGraphQLDataSource {
  async willSendRequest({ request, context }) {
    const { userId } = await decode(context.jwt);
    request.http.headers.set('x-user-id', userId);
  }
}

@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: AuthenticatedDataSource,
      useValue: AuthenticatedDataSource,
    },
    {
      provide: GATEWAY_BUILD_SERVICE,
      useFactory: AuthenticatedDataSource => {
        return ({ name, url }) => new AuthenticatedDataSource({ url });
      },
      inject: [AuthenticatedDataSource],
    },
  ],
  exports: [GATEWAY_BUILD_SERVICE],
})
class BuildServiceModule {}

@Module({
  imports: [
    GraphQLGatewayModule.forRootAsync({
      useFactory: async () => ({
        gateway: {
          serviceList: [
            /* services */
          ],
        },
        server: {
          context: ({ req }) => ({
            jwt: req.headers.authorization,
          }),
        },
      }),
      imports: [BuildServiceModule],
      inject: [GATEWAY_BUILD_SERVICE],
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

#### Async configuration

Both the Federation and Gateway modules support asynchronous initialization using the same `forRootAsync` that's documented in [Quick start](/graphql/quick-start#async-configuration).
