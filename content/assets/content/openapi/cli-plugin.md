### CLI Plugin

TypeScript's metadata reflection system has several limitations which make it impossible to, for instance, determine what properties a class consists of or recognize whether a given property is optional or required. However, some of these constraints can be addressed at compilation time. Nest provides a plugin that enhances the TypeScript compilation process to reduce the amount of boilerplate code required.

> warning **Hint** This plugin is **opt-in**. If you prefer, you can declare all decorators manually, or only specific decorators where you need them.

#### Overview

The Swagger plugin will automatically:

- annotate all DTO properties with `@ApiProperty` unless `@ApiHideProperty` is used
- set the `required` property depending on the question mark (e.g. `name?: string` will set `required: false`)
- set the `type` or `enum` property depending on the type (supports arrays as well)
- set the `default` property based on the assigned default value
- set several validation rules based on `class-validator` decorators (if `classValidatorShim` set to `true`)
- add a response decorator to every endpoint with a proper status and `type` (response model)

Please, note that your filenames **must have** one of the following suffixes: `['.dto.ts', '.entity.ts']` (e.g., `create-user.dto.ts`) in order to be analysed by the plugin.

If you are using a different suffix, you can adjust the plugin's behavior by specifying the `dtoFileNameSuffix` option (see below).

Previously, if you wanted to provide an interactive experience with the Swagger UI,
you had to duplicate a lot of code to let the package know how your models/components should be declared in the specification. For example, you could define a simple `CreateUserDto` class as follows:

```typescript
export class CreateUserDto {
  @ApiProperty()
  email: string;

  @ApiProperty()
  password: string;

  @ApiProperty({ enum: RoleEnum, default: [], isArray: true })
  roles: RoleEnum[] = [];

  @ApiProperty({ required: false, default: true })
  isEnabled?: boolean = true;
}
```

While not a significant issue with medium-sized projects, it becomes verbose & hard to maintain once you have a large set of classes.

By enabling the Swagger plugin, the above class definition can be declared simply:

```typescript
export class CreateUserDto {
  email: string;
  password: string;
  roles: RoleEnum[] = [];
  isEnabled?: boolean = true;
}
```

The plugin adds appropriate decorators on the fly based on the **Abstract Syntax Tree**. Thus you won't have to struggle with `@ApiProperty` decorators scattered throughout the code.

> warning **Hint** The plugin will automatically generate any missing swagger properties, but if you need to override them, you simply set them explicitly via `@ApiProperty()`.

#### Using the CLI plugin

To enable the plugin, open `nest-cli.json` (if you use [Nest CLI](/cli/overview)) and add the following `plugins` configuration:

```javascript
{
  "collection": "@nestjs/schematics",
  "sourceRoot": "src",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": ["@nestjs/swagger/plugin"]
  }
}
```

You can use the `options` property to customize the behavior of the plugin.

```javascript
"plugins": [
  {
    "name": "@nestjs/swagger/plugin",
    "options": {
      "classValidatorShim": false
    }
  }
]
```

The `options` property has to fulfill the following interface:

```typescript
export interface PluginOptions {
  dtoFileNameSuffix?: string[];
  controllerFileNameSuffix?: string[];
  classValidatorShim?: boolean;
}
```

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Option</th>
    <th>Default</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>dtoFileNameSuffix</code></td>
    <td><code>['.dto.ts', '.entity.ts']</code></td>
    <td>DTO (Data Transfer Object) files suffix</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>controllerFileNameSuffix</code></td>
    <td><code>.controller.ts</code></td>
    <td>Controller files suffix</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>classValidatorShim</code></td>
    <td><code>true</code></td>
    <td>If set to true, the module will reuse <code>class-validator</code> validation decorators (e.g. <code>@Max(10)</code> will add <code>max: 10</code> to schema definition) </td>
  </tr>
</table>

If you don't use the CLI but instead have a custom `webpack` configuration, you can use this plugin in combination with `ts-loader`:

```javascript
getCustomTransformers: (program: any) => ({
  before: [require('@nestjs/swagger/plugin').before({}, program)]
}),
```
