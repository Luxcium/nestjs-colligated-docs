 - This document is Â´writtenÂ´ by a proud *script kiddy* using the `cat` command so all the power and all the merit of hard work is for the [Cat Person](https://github.com/kamilmysliwiec)!!! Tanks to the MIT License I have been able to Â´writeÂ´ all this document by myself without, copy-pasting code or scripts, (*Like Real Script Kiddies always do*). in fact I have used my own script: [`cat-docs.sh`](https://github.com/Luxcium/nestjs-colligated-docs/blob/master/cat-docs.sh)

**So without further ado let me tell you the truth, the text contained in this document is the resuld of the hard work of Kamil MyÅ›liwiec**
