# Nest Colligated Documentation

This document is ´written´ by a proud *Script Kiddy* using the **`cat`** command so all the power and all the merit of this hard work is dedicated to the [Cat Person](https://github.com/kamilmysliwiec)! Tanks to the [MIT License](https://github.com/nestjs/docs.nestjs.com/blob/master/LICENSE) I have been able to ´write´ this document all by myself, without copy-pasting code or scripts from anyone else, *Like Real Script Kiddies always do†*. In fact I have used my own script: [`cat-docs.sh`](https://github.com/Luxcium/nestjs-colligated-docs/blob/master/cat-docs.sh) to colligate the documentation.

We all know (or your just learning now), [@Luxcium](https://github.com/Luxcium) is a cute and nice little *Script Kiddy* but also, we all know that the MIT License require to include the copyright notice and *blah blah blah*, so without further ado let me tell you the truth, the text contained in this document is the result of the hard work of *[Kamil Myśliwiec](http://kamilmysliwiec.com)*
